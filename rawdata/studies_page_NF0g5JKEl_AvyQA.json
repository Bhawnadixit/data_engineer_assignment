                    "briefSummary": "Osteoarthritis is a very prevalent pathology after the fifth decade of life. It usually appears in the hip and hand, although its presence in the knee is even greater, with a prevalence in subjects over 45 years of age of 19% radiographically (radiographic findings without taking symptoms into account) and 7% in the symptomatic population, for those over 60 years of age, 37% radiographic and 12% symptomatic and finally, for those over 75 years of age there was 50% of osteoarthritis of the knee diagnosed by radiographs and 33% were symptomatic. There are gender differences: the lifetime risk of suffering knee osteoarthritis is estimated at 40% for men and 47% for women. Furthermore, the impact of this pathology is significant, being the most frequent cause of gait-related disability in adults in the United States.\n\nDifferent approaches have been proposed for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Currently, clinical practice guidelines place therapeutic exercise and education as the first line of treatment, reserving joint replacement surgery in case of failure of conservative treatment and only if there is severe disability.\n\nIn recent years, due to the pandemic, there has been an accelerated development of telemedicine and telerehabilitation in all its aspects. Applications and websites have been developed for online rehabilitation. An example of this is TRAK, a telerehabilitation web tool that allows the creation of a profile for each patient and the design of personalized exercise programs and the periodization of the sessions to be carried out. During the execution of the exercises, the screen of the split phone will appear, displaying on one side the execution of the exercise by a model and on the other side, the patient sees himself performing the exercise. This tool allows the monitoring of the therapeutic exercise without the need to go to a consultation or to be in front of a physiotherapist, reducing the economic and time investment.\n\nThus, the present work tries to compare the treatment with exercises monitored by means of the TRAK application with the performance of the same exercises, without the help of this tool."

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects crossover design will be used to examine the dose-effects of THC (0, 5mg, 30mg) on oculomotor performance tasks and a sustained attention task in frequent and infrequent cannabis users. Results from the study will advance the investigators' understanding of the effect of THC and cannabis use frequency on oculomotor function and sustained attention, and will directly inform the validity of the investigators' oculomotor platform for identifying acute THC- induced impairment in frequent and infrequent users."

                    "briefSummary": "This is a single randomised controlled trial. The investigators plan to randomise 800 participants to the levofloxacin plus metronidazole suppositories versus levofloxacin co-administered with metronidazole tablets for the treatment of chronic endometritis in a 1:1 rate. Primary outcome will be the live birth rate after the embryo transfer.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Chronic endometritis (CE) is a pathological condition characterized by inflammation and destruction of the endometrium. In this disease state, microorganisms coexist with the host's immune system in a balanced manner. However, for the majority of patients with CE, clinical symptoms are nonspecific and atypical, rendering diagnosis based on clinical signs or blood tests unreliable. Consequently, invasive procedures such as histopathological examination of the endometrium or hysteroscopy are often necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis. The infiltration of plasma cells in the endometrial stroma associated with CE, together with increased production of immunoglobulins and pro-inflammatory cytokines, can reduce endometrial receptivity. This reduction in receptivity can lead to an increased risk of female infertility, lower pregnancy rates, and reduced live birth rates, which are linked to unexplained infertility, repeated failure of embryo implantation, and recurrent miscarriages. While the etiology of CE remains elusive, it is widely believed to be related to infection by pathogenic microorganisms such as Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus , Klebsiella pneumoniae, Ureaplasma, and Mycoplasma, which can ascend from the vagina into the uterine cavity. Preliminary basic research by investigators also supports the notion that bacterial infections are a leading cause of endometritis. The mainstay of CE treatment currently involves oral antibiotics, with a common regimen being colabitux (500 mg once daily for 14 days) in combination with metronidazole (400 mg twice daily for 14 days). However, oral antibiotics can face issues such as drug resistance, suboptimal local concentrations of the drug, and a propensity to cause gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, and dermatological reactions like skin rashes and leukopenia, which can lead to treatment interruptions and reduced efficacy in managing chronic endometritis. Therefore, there is a need to explore methods to enhance the treatment success rate of CE. Metronidazole suppositories, composed primarily of metronidazole, are used vaginally to treat bacterial infections and other types of bacterial-induced vaginitis. Acting directly on the local area, these suppositories typically exhibit faster and more pronounced therapeutic effects without adversely affecting other tissues and organs. Given that the vagina is connected to the uterine cavity via the cervix, investigators hypothesized that local vaginal administration of the medication might be more effective. This approach not only achieves higher local concentrations of the drug in the uterine cavity, but also prevents ascending infection of vaginal bacteria.\n\nIn the prospective, randomized study conducted by investigators, the efficacy of levofloxacin plus metronidazole suppository versus levofloxacin co-administered with metronidazole tablets was compared in patients with chronic endometritis. By comparing the pregnancy outcomes of the two groups, the aim was to identify a superior treatment strategy, enhance treatment efficacy, and improve clinical outcomes.\n\nPurpose The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of metronidazole therapy in enhancing treatment outcomes for chronic endometritis, with the aim of increasing clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in IVF procedures, reducing miscarriage rates, and thereby offering a safer and more effective treatment option for participants with chronic endometritis who are considering pregnancy.\n\nDesign This study is designed as a randomized controlled trial. Study Population\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Infertile participants between the ages of 20 and 42.\n2. Participants who have undergone hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy, resulting in a pathological diagnosis of chronic endometritis.\n3. Participants with a blood FSH level of 12 U/L on the second day of their menstrual cycle.\n4. Participants who have provided informed consent and signed the consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participants diagnosed with uterine submucosal fibroids, a history of uterine malformations or previous corrective surgeries for such deformities, uterine intrauterine adhesions, or a history of pelvic tuberculosis or endometrial tuberculosis, including cases with pathology suggesting endometrial tuberculosis.\n2. Participants or their partners with a history of fetal or child chromosomal abnormalities and those planning a pre-implantation genetic screening.\n3. Participants with a well-documented clear history of allergy to the study medication."

                    "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells in up to 4 cohorts. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy will not be utilized as part of the planned dosing strategy.\n\n\u2022 Cohort 1 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\\^7/m\\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 via intravenous infusion.\n\n* Enrollment into Cohort 1 will be paused after the 3rd subject is infused to allow for a formal DLT assessment (performed by the Clinical PI and Medical Director) and DSMB review. If 1 DLT/3 subjects occurs in Cohort 1, the Sponsor (with guidance from the DSMB), will determine whether the study will enroll an additional 3 subjects at this dose level to further establish safety via intravenous infusion, or advance to Cohorts 2 and 3 to explore local delivery of huCART-meso cells at the same dose level. If 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects occurs at any time, the study may advance to Cohorts 2 and 3.\n* If 2 DLTs occur at this dose level at any time, enrollment in Cohort 1 will be stopped and the dose will be de-escalated by 10-fold to 1-3x10\\^6 cells/m\\^2 (Cohort -1).\n* The infusions in Cohort 1 will be staggered by at least 28 days to allow for the assessment of DLTs for cohort progression, expansion, or dose de-escalation.\n\nIn the event that 2 DLTs occur among subjects enrolled in Cohort 1, then enrollment in Cohort 1 will be stopped and the dose will be de-escalated by 10-fold to 1-3x10\\^6 cells/m\\^2. This de-escalated cohort will be designated Cohort -1.\n\n\u2022 Cohort -1 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\\^6 cells/m\\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0. Up to 6 subjects will be infused in Cohort -1 if \u2264 1 DLT occurs.\n\nIf 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects occurs in Cohort 1, the study will advance to allow for additional cohorts to be explored.\n\n* Cohorts 2 and 3. Enrollment into these additional cohorts may occur in parallel, however infusions will be staggered as follows to allow for monitoring/assessment of toxicities:\n* Cohorts 2 and 3: As of Protocol Amendment V7, Infusion #1/Day 0 for the next 6 subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 must be staggered by at least 28 days; This includes a minimum of 3 evaluable subjects in Cohort 2 and 3 evaluable subjects in Cohort 3. A DLT assessment will be performed after the 3rd evaluable subject in each cohort reaches the Day 21 safety follow-up visit. If no DLTs are identified in the 1st three evaluable subjects in both Cohorts 2 + 3, subsequent infusions of new subjects within either cohort may occur in parallel; however, no more than two new subjects may be infused within a 14-day period, irrespective of cohort assignment. If both cohorts have not yet infused 3 evaluable subjects without a DLT, all infusions will continue to be staggered by 28 days until this provision is met.\n* Cohort 4: Infusion #1/Day 0 for the first 3 subjects in Cohort 4 must be staggered by at least 28 days. A DLT assessment will be performed after the 3rd evaluable subject in this cohort reaches the Day 21 safety follow-up visit. If no DLTs are identified in the 1st three evaluable subjects, subsequent infusions of new subjects may occur in parallel, however no more than two new subjects may be infused within a 14-day period. If 1 DLT is identified in the 1st three evaluable subjects, Infusion #1 for all subsequent subjects will continue to be staggered by at least 28 days and DLT assessments will be performed after each evaluable subject reaches the Day 21 safety follow-up visit.\n\n  * Cohort 2 Participants (N = Up to 6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\\^7/m\\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 via intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. The initial i.p. infusion may be followed by up to two additional infusions of huCART-meso cells via intravenous (IV) administration at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart. The subject must meet eligibility to receive additional infusions.\n\n\\*\\*Cohort 2 is prematurely closed. This closure is the result of feasibility concerns specific to the clinical/disease status of these patients at this stage of their treatment.\\*\\*\n\n\u2022 Cohort 3 Participants (N = Up to 6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\\^7/m\\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 via intrahepatic delivery (Hepatic Arterial Infusion). The initial intrahepatic infusion may be followed by up to two additional infusions of huCART-meso cells via intravenous (IV) administration at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart. The subject must meet eligibility to receive additional infusions.\n\n\\*\\*Cohort 3 is prematurely closed. This closure is the result of feasibility concerns specific to the clinical/disease status of these patients at this stage of their treatment.\\*\\*\n\n\u2022 Cohort 4 Participants (N = Up to 6): will allow for the administration of lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells during 1st line standard of care chemotherapy. A single dose of 1-3x10\\^7/m\\^2 huCART-meso cells will be administered on day 0 via intrahepatic delivery (Hepatic Arterial Infusion), following a 1 week washout after standard of care chemotherapy. This initial intrahepatic infusion may be followed by up to two additional infusions of huCART-meso cells via intravenous (IV) administration at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart. The subject must meet all eligibility to receive additional infusions. Additional doses of standard of care chemotherapy may also be administered between huCART-meso infusions at the physician-investigator's discretion, as long as the required washout windows are appropriately adhered to. huCART-meso infusions may also be discontinued at any time in favor of resuming standard of care chemotherapy at the physician-investigator's discretion.\n\nAdverse events will be collected and evaluated during the protocol specified adverse event reporting period. Subjects will be continually evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). In the event of 2 DLTs in a specific cohort, additional enrollment and treatment activity will be paused to allow for further investigation."

Among 14-16 year old youth with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), the investigators aim to assess the effect of an online training and peer support platform (Support-t) integrated in usual care, compared with usual care on Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), adverse outcomes and psychosocial measures during the preparation for transition to adult care. The investigators will conduct a multi-site, parallel group, blinded (outcome assessors, data analysts), superiority RCT of adolescents with T1D (14-16 years of age) followed at one of 4 university teaching hospital-based pediatric diabetes clinics in the province of Quebec.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The transition from pediatric to adult diabetes care is a challenging period for adolescents and young adults living with chronic conditions, such as Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). For youth with T1D, transition from pediatric to adult care is characterized by deterioration in glycemic control (Hemoglobin A1c \\[HbA1c\\]), reduced adherence to diabetes management tasks and increased risk of diabetes complications. The investigators propose to examine an online training and peer support platform as a potential alternative for delivering transition care. In adolescents with T1D, the investigators hypothesize that an online training and peer support platform (Support-t), when integrated into usual pediatric care, as compared with usual care alone, will result in better HbA1c, less adverse outcomes and better psychosocial outcomes during the preparation for transfer to adult care.\n\nPrimary Aim: To determine the impact of adding access to Support-t to usual care compared with usual care alone, on HbA1c during the preparation for transfer to adult care.\n\nSecondary Aims: To determine the impact of adding access to Support-t to usual care compared with usual care alone, on self-efficacy, diabetes distress, quality of life (QOL; diabetes specific), readiness to transfer to adult care, glucose management, severe hypoglycemic episodes, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), T1D-related ED-visits and hospitalizations during the preparation for transfer to adult care. 2. To determine the cost-effectiveness of Support-t. 3. To understand the context for implementation in regards to level of engagement on Support-t, satisfaction and experience (barriers, facilitators) with Support-t.\n\nMethods: The investigators will conduct a multi-site, parallel group, blinded (outcome assessors, data analysts), superiority RCT of adolescents with T1D (14-16 years of age) followed at one of 4 university teaching hospital-based pediatric diabetes clinics in Quebec. Patients will be recruited over 20 months. Interventions will occur over 18 months. Follow-up will be to 18 months from enrollment. Allocation will be concealed with a 1:1 intervention to control ratio. Participants in the active arm will have access to a mobile-based online training and peer support platform (Support-t) added to usual care. Participants in the control group will have in parallel with the intervention group, their usual diabetes care. The primary outcome is the change in HbA1c measured at 18 months (HbA1c measured at 18 months - HbA1c measured at baseline). Secondary outcomes are self-efficacy, diabetes distress, QOL, readiness to transfer, glucose management, severe hypoglycemic episodes, DKA, T1D-related ED-visits and hospitalizations. Assessments are at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. Analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Outcomes will be calculated and compared between the 2 trial arms using differences with 95% Confidence Intervals, along with a cost-effectiveness analysis. Interviews will be conducted to analyze the context for implementation."

                    "briefSummary": "Introduction: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly detected cancer in men and is the second leading cause of cancer death. Differences in race and ethnicity have been shown to have differences in PCa incidence, detection, and outcomes. Current prostate cancer screening involves prostatic specific antigen (PSA) which is a nonspecific protein marker (aka kallikrein) that can often leads to unnecessary biopsies (up to 74% benign biopsies) and clinical overdiagnosis (with up to 22% clinically insignificant cancer). Recently more sophisticated tests have been developed for PCa screening in the United States such as the Prostate Health Index (PHI) and the 4k (kallikrein) score, as well as clinical models that use information from the patient clinical history. However, these tests utilize limited serum protein assays and none of the established screening protocols utilize genetic variables to help account for the likely inherited risks as seen in different ethnicities.\n\nA recent Swedish, prospective, population-based study, published in the Lancet Oncology, developed a unique multivariable biopsy outcome prediction model within a Nordic population of nearly 60,000 men. This model, the Stockholm3, which incorporated plasma protein markers, germline DNA SNPs as well as clinical variables, was shown to be capable of reducing the number of biopsies by 44% compared to PSA while maintaining adequate sensitivity for detection of PCa.\n\nIt is unknown whether an approach developed in Sweden that incorporates protein markers, genetics, clinical variables, and genetic ancestry would be beneficial in a racially diverse cohort.\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that, a prospectively studied multiethnic cohort of men with the Stockholm3 test will identify unique and common risk factors that improve prostate cancer detection.\n\nAim: To assess the performance of the Stockholm3 test as compared to PSA and to identify unique features associated with PCa in Black/African American (n=500), Asian (n=500), White/Caucasian Hispanic (n=500), and White/Caucasian Non-Hispanic (n=500) men.\n\nMethods: The investigators propose a prospectively identified cohort with participating institutions which have screened positive to undergo a prostate biopsy to have a retrospective analysis the Stockholm3 test and ancestry markers. Within this cohort the investigators will examine several predetermined risk factors to investigate their relationship to prostate cancer.\n\nThis blood sample will be tested for quantitative levels of serum protein markers and DNA will be extracted and will be tested for germline mutations as defined by the Stockholm3 test and other ancestry informative markers. Results from the study will be presented in such a way that no individual information will be disclosed.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Study Design and Procedures:\n\nThe research coordinator will explain the information contained within the consent. Additionally, patient's blood will be drawn prior to their biopsy.\n\nPrior to the biopsy, blood will be collected in x2 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 4 ml tubes after obtaining consent from the subjects. One tube will be immediately centrifuged (10 minutes at 2000G) and plasma decanted to a tube without additives (this typically produces 1.5 ml of plasma). The decanted tube (with plasma) and the remaining EDTA tube (with whole blood) is then frozen and stored at the designated participating institutional site. It will be stored at -20 Celsius until being shipped. The SEPTA specific blood collection is followed by the following collaborators: Uropartners, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Chicago, Rush Medical Center, Montefiore, University of Texas Health Science Center of San Antonio, Urology Clinics of North Texas, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles County Hospital, Stanford University.\n\nAdditional samples from University Health Network (Toronto), Northwestern Medicine, John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, and Cook County Health System (Chicago) will be included from biobanked sources which were prospective collected meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nPatient data will be stored in a REDCap database, hosted on Sweden's secure server. Data will be stored for the duration of the study, and 5 years afterwards for data analysis purposes.\n\nConsented patients will be tracked by patient logs by each participating institution. The medical record number will be collected to keep a consistent identifier for data collection by key site personnel. Once all the patient data is recorded the data will be exported from REDCap with the MRN removed. There will be no patient identifiers used at the Karolinska Institute or A3P lab. The following PHI and non-PHI information will be logged of the patient:\n\nPHI:\n\nMedical record number (MRN)\n\nNon-PHI Demographic data\n\n* Stockholm3 Identification number\n* Race\n* Zip code\n\nClinical data\n\n* Total PSA\n* Age on sampling date \\[years\\]\n* Family history of prostate cancer\n* Use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors\n* Earlier biopsy conducted\n* Prostate volume \\[Prostate volume as measure with US\\]\n* Digital rectal exam status \\[Benign/normal, Nodule/induration felt, Asymmetry, Not performed\\]\n\nAND\n\nOutcome data - Results from biopsy performed immediately after blood venipuncture, i.e.:\n\nResults will be separated into targeted biopsy cores and systematic biopsy cores\n\n* Gleason Score 1\n* Gleason Score 2\n* Gleason Sum\n* Cancer length (mm) (total and highest grade)\n* Number of cores\n* Number of positive cores\n* Time to perform biopsy after blood draw \\[days\\]\n* Results from MRI, i.e. Prostate Imaging Reporting \\& Data System (PIRADS) (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nPermitted use:\n\nTo run the Stockholm3 test defined by Gronberg et al AND Ancestry informative genetic markers\n\nSamples will be shipped to the Uppsala based laboratory (A23 Laboratory) in Sweden for analysis. Each patient will have two blood samples (plasma and whole blood) and will be frozen at -20 Celsius. The blood samples will then be tested for quantitative levels of serum protein levels and DNA will be extracted from white blood cells and will be tested for gene and small nucleotide polymorphic (SNPs) germline mutations and variants .\n\nGenotyping will be performed using custom genotyping assays. Plasma will be used for protein analysis. Plasma protein analysis will be performed using a custom protein assays including total and free PSA, human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2), microseminoprotein-beta (MSMB), and Macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1). PSA will be tested with a commercial assay.\n\nBased on the results from the plasma protein analysis, the genetic analysis and clinical data, the Stockholm3 Risk Score will be calculated. The participants' samples will be treated in accordance with the regulations of Sweden at the laboratory based in Uppsala, Sweden.\n\nResults of the tests will not be shared with the patient, nor will the results change or impact medical decisions.\n\nExpected Risks/Benefits\n\nAnticipated Risks:\n\nAs this is retrospective analysis of deidentified patient information as well as deidentified biospecimens, there are few anticipated risks. A confidentiality breach as well as loss of privacy are possible, however every effort will be made to minimize this risk.\n\nAnticipated Benefits:\n\nParticipants will advance scientific and clinical knowledge. Participants will also receive a small payment for the time and involvement in the study.\n\nData Collection and Management Procedures\n\nThis study will utilize REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of clinical and research data, to collect and store data. The Karolinska Institute Information Technology (KI-IT) Department will be used as a central location for data processing and management. REDCap is hosted by KI-IT in the Biomedicum (Solnav\u00e4gen 9, Solna, Sweden 17165)\n\nData Analysis\n\nData analysis will be performed by the PI, co-investigators and/or key research personnel.\n\nQuality Control and Quality Assurance\n\nKey research personnel will be responsible for ensuring all data collected adheres to the protocol.\n\nData and Safety Monitoring\n\nThis study is minimal risk and all efforts will be made to ensure there are no confidentiality breaches as well as no loss of privacy.\n\nStatistical Considerations\n\nPower analysis This study is being conducted among several sites and thus pooled analysis will be performed. Based on the framework developed a two-sided alpha of 0.05, 250 men in each ethnicity gives 80% power to detect 10 percentage points differences in sensitivity and/or specificity of the Stockholm3 test across different ethnicities. Pooled data from several sites will allow for comparison between non-Hispanic White, Africa/Black, Asian, and Hispanic White men. Within each ethnicity group of 250 men, the same sample size gives a 90% power for detecting differences in area under curve (AUC) between Stockholm3 and PSA for detection of PC that are at least 10 percentage points (primary aim).\n\nGoal accruement is 500 men within each race/ethnicity, interim analysis will be performed when 250 men in each race/ethnicity is enrolled.\n\nData Analysis Descriptive univariate statistics will be used to compare groups. Binary endpoints will be assessed with a logistic regression model. Statistical analysis will involve logistic regression modeling, AUC calculation, calibration analyses and calculation of basic performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values).\n\nRegulatory Requirements\n\nInformed Consent The participants indicate their consent to participate in the study by signing informed consents for accessing medical records, conducting genetic research and undergoing venipuncture for blood samples.\n\nSubject Confidentiality Data used for this study will be stored in REDCaps and all data transferred between institutions will remain deidentified throughout the study.\n\nUnanticipated Problems Any unanticipated problems will be immediately reported to the Site-specific ethical review board by designated research personnel."

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this prospective randomized clinical trial is to investigate the effect of music intervention on the stress of live born preterm neonates requiring admission to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, through the measurements of salivary biomarkers (hormones and proteins).\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is:\n\nCan the daily music intervention reduce the stress levels created by the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit environment in preterm neonates?\n\nResearchers will compare preterm neonates who will not be exposed to music intervention to investigate potential discrepancies in salivary stress biomarkers.\n\nParticipants will be exposed to recorded music for 5 consecutive days.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Study Design In this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, live born preterm neonates should have a stable clinical status at the time of study enrollment and therefore it is likely that some neonates will be enrolled after 5-7 days of admission. The allocation of neonates will be randomized in order to equalize the prognostic factors (confounding factors) between the groups. By using sequentially numbered envelopes, participants will be assigned to either intervention or control group by simple random allocation. In this way, researchers will avoid resulting in an unequal number of participants between the two groups. Researchers after obtaining parental informed consent, will request a sealed envelope from a staff member not involved in the study. The envelope will be opened and the allocation will be documented on a list, and signed by a member of the research team and a staff member as witness.\n\nParticipants The study will recruit preterm neonates. It has been estimated that with a sample of 35 neonates per group, the study will have more than 85% power to find differences in biomarkers between the intervention and control group, with an effect size equal to or greater than 0.72 and a significance level of 0.05.\n\nMusic Intervention Neonates will be placed in a closed incubator whose acoustic properties have been previously studied. Under the close surveillance of a team member, monitor alarms will be also silenced so as to decrease exposure to sudden and unpleasant auditory stimuli during music intervention. A mini portable speaker will be settled inside the incubator in appropriate conditions (volume level, distance e.t.c) for safety reasons.\n\nNeonates allocated to the intervention group will be exposed to a specific piece of music, 30 minutes after feeding (if oral feeding exists), for a duration no more than 30 minutes that will be indicated from the certified music - therapist, experienced in working with preterm infants.\n\nA questionnaire created by the research team will be administered to parents in order to investigate the neonate's prenatal exposure of music (as a fetus).\n\nData collection Biomarkers Salivary samples will be obtained from preterm neonates via salivette swabs. The polyester filter of the device will be partitioned into equal sections under sterile conditions to account for the small oral size of the neonates. One sample will be obtained before the music intervention and one sample 60 minutes after the music intervention, considering diurnal flow patterns. Saliva sampling is unlikely to cause stress or pain to the neonate. In the control group only one sample per day will be obtained within the same time period with the intervention group. Sample collection will be repeated in the same way everyday for 5 consecutive days. Each sample will be obtained before any stressful intervention (e.g. blood sampling, weighing, bathing, etc.). Furthermore, it is important to note that no other procedure that may reduce stress will take place simultaneously with music intervention (i.e. kangaroo care, gentle touching e.t.c) in order to interpret the effect of music more precisely. Saliva samples will be centrifuged very soon after collection and stored at -80oC until the laboratory analyses are performed. Measurements will be performed with cobas e411 automated analyzer or through ELISA."

The patients will have this MRI preoperatively and at 24 months postop. The investigators believe that with this imaging, biomarkers will be able to be seen to assist in prediction of long term outcomes in patients with spinal cord compression. These patients will be compared to healthy cohorts who will also undergo an MRI using the DBSI technology.",
                    "detailedDescription": "CSM is the most common form of spinal cord injury and is the leading cause of progressive disability in patients over the age of 65. A major shortcoming limiting the clinical management of CSM is the lack of quantifiable metrics to 1) base clinical decisions and 2) predict potential for functional recovery following surgical intervention. DBSI MRI will provide imaging biomarkers to more reliably predict a patient's clinical course, response to therapy, and long-term prognosis.\n\nPatients who are diagnosed with CSM will have an MRI using the DBSI technology preoperatively and at 24 months. Surgical patients will be assessed with the Neck Disability Index (NDI), Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), hand grip dynamometer and Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (mJOA), and the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Nurick scoring.\n\nA control group of healthy volunteers will have an MRI using the DBSI technology when enrolled and then again between 12-24 months later."
