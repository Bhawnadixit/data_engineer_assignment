Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the blocks postoperatively under spinal anesthesia. The blocks will be administered by experienced anesthesiologists, and informed consent will be obtained from all participants.\n\nPain levels will be assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and during movement at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours post-surgery. Opioid consumption will be recorded through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and any need for rescue analgesia will be evaluated. Routine postoperative pain management will also include intravenous paracetamol.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This prospective, multicenter, observational study will be conducted at Ba\u015fak\u015fehir \u00c7am and Sakura City Hospital and Kanuni Sultan S\u00fcleyman Training and Research Hospital. The study will include patients aged 18 and older, with an ASA score of I-II-III, undergoing femoral neck fracture surgery under spinal anesthesia. Patients with no history of bleeding diathesis, anticoagulant use, or allergies to the drugs used in the study, and without neuropathic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, will be randomly assigned to receive either the Pericapsular Nerve Group (PENG) block or the Quadroiliac Plane Block (QIPB) postoperatively.\n\nInformed consent will be obtained from all patients, and detailed explanations of both blocks will be provided. Randomization will be performed using a computer program, assigning patients to either block method. Sealed envelopes will be provided to the anesthesiologists, who will apply the block indicated in the envelope at the end of surgery. Both blocks will be performed by experienced anesthesiologists, and only patients operated on under spinal anesthesia will be included in the study.\n\nPENG Block Procedure:\n\nWith the patient in the supine position, the ultrasound probe is placed transversely over the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). After identifying the ASIS, the transducer is aligned with the pubic ramus and rotated approximately 45 degrees to become parallel to the inguinal crease. The transducer is moved medially until the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS), iliopubic eminence (IPE), and psoas tendon are clearly visualized as anatomical landmarks. After confirming the correct location with saline injection, 50 mg of 0.25% bupivacaine will be administered.\n\nQIP Block Procedure:\n\nWith the patient in the prone position, a low-frequency convex transducer (2-6 MHz) and a 22G x 100 mm peripheral nerve block needle (Stimuplex\u00ae Ultra 360\u00ae, B-Braun) will be used. The transducer will be placed transversely at the L3 level to identify the spinal processes, followed by lateral movement to visualize the transverse process within the erector spinae muscle. The transducer will then be rotated parasagittally and moved caudally to locate where the Quadratus Lumborum muscle (QLM) attaches to the iliac crest. After confirming the location with saline, 50 mg of 0.25% bupivacaine will be administered under the fascia of the QLM.\n\nPostoperative Analgesia:\n\nPatients will receive intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with 2 mg/mL Tramadol HCl in 100 mL NaCl solution, delivered via bolus doses of 20 mg with a 20-minute lockout period and a total dose limit of 200 mg over 4 hours. Pain scores using the visual analog scale (VAS) will be recorded at rest and with movement at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours. The total opioid consumption and the need for rescue analgesia (50 mg deksketoprofen in 100 mL mediflex over 20 minutes) will also be assessed. Routine administration of 1 g of intravenous paracetamol will be given at 6 hours postoperatively."

This leads to accumulation of copper ions in multiple organs such as liver, brain and kidney, resulting in organ involvement. In this study, rAAV8 as the carrier of gene therapy products. After a single intravenous infusion, ATP7B protein can be specifically transduced to the target organ liver and expressed in hepatocytes for a long time.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This study adopted a prospective, single-center, open, single-arm, single-dose clinical design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, immunogenicity, PD and PK characteristics of LY-M003 injection in WD patients, including the main study phase and the long-term follow-up study phase.\n\nThe main study phase consisted of a screening period (weeks -8 to days -2), a baseline period (days -1), a treatment and safety observation period (days 1-28), and a short-term follow-up period (weeks 5 \\[starting from days 29\\] to 52). Subjects eligible for the screening period will be admitted to the study Center for a single LY-M003 treatment, and will enter the short-term follow-up period after the end of the treatment and safety observation period and complete all follow-up during the main study phase. Subjects who withdraw early from the study will be required to complete all assessments required for the End of Study (EOS) visit.\n\nSubjects who complete the main study phase or withdraw early from the study will enter the long-term follow-up study phase to obtain long-term evaluation data. After the completion of the 5-year long-term follow-up in this study, based on the obtained safety and efficacy data of this product, it will be discussed by the investigators and partners to determine whether further extension of follow-up time is necessary."

The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of CMTX-101 in healthy volunteers followed by a similar assessment in patients with suspected or confirmed community acquired bacterial pneumonia of moderate severity.\n\nThe main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n* Are single ascending doses of a CMTX-101 intravenous (IV) infusion safe and tolerated\n* What is the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single-ascending doses CMTX 101\n* Do single ascending doses of CMTX 101 induce development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (Nabs)\n\nExploratory efficacy biomarkers will also be measured in the patient part of the study. Participants will be administered a single IV infusion of CMTX-101 over a 60-minute period; patients will receive the infusion after starting standard of care antibiotics."

                    "briefSummary": "The growing resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobials is a major threat to public health nowadays. Reducing the consumption of antibiotics is one of the main strategies to control this issue. Protocols using biomarkers to guide antimicrobial therapy have been studied, with promising results in safely reducing patient exposure to these drugs by reducing duration of treatments. Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) represent the most promising biomarkers in this context. Although less studied, CRP has the potential advantages of lower cost and wide availability when compared to PCT. However, decision algorithms involving biomarkers proposed in studies published so far are very far from daily medical practice in hospitals, mainly because there is poor accessibility to these protocols, and because most of them do not contemplate each patients clinical variables. The objective of this project is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a multimodal protocol using clinical variables and the CRP value to guide antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients. This protocol will be applied diretcly by the assistant medical teams through a digital clinical decision support tool available in the form of an application for mobile devices developed by the research team.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The research team will perform a randomized, controlled, concurrent, open, single-center clinical trial. The proposed intervention is the application of a protocol that uses clinical variables and the CRP value to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. As for the control group, the duration of antibiotic therapy will be suggested according to the best available evidence, considering the primary site of infection and other characteristics of this process. For both groups, the study protocol will be applied through a digital application for use on smartphones or tablets, developed specifically for this project. Participants will be adults admitted to the internal medicine ward of the Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (HC-UFMG), for whom the assistant physician team has started antibiotic therapy in the last 72 hours. Patients will be allocated after signing a free and informed consent form. Follow-up will be carried out until hospital discharge, death or 90 days, whichever occurs first. The project was submitted for consideration to the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (COEP-UFMG) and approved. As primary outcome, the duration of antibiotic therapy will be evaluated for the infectious episode that motivated inclusion in the study. Duration of antibiotic therapy will be measured by antimicrobial days (defined by the aggregate of days a specific antimicrobial agent was administered to an individual patient) per 1000 present days (defined by the length of time during which a given patient is at risk for antimicrobial exposure at a given institution). As secondary outcomes, the investigators will assess total exposure to antimicrobials, antibiotic-free days, user satisfaction after using the digital tool, protocol adherence rate, length of stay, estimated cost of antimicrobial therapy, all-cause hospital mortality, therapeutic failure, reinfection rate, subsequent infections with multidrug-resistant microorganisms, Clostridioides difficile infection."

                    "briefSummary": "Thumb osteoarthritis or trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (TMO) is a common and painful form of hand arthritis that limits thumb mobility and hand function, affecting patients' quality of life. Although corticosteroids injections are a typical treatment, their effectiveness has been challenged, and side effects have been reported. Recent studies suggest that saline injections, usually considered inactive, might be a viable treatment option. The primary goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of saline injections versus corticosteroids injections in reducing TMO-related pain and improving hand function. In this study, 40 people with TMO will be randomly assigned to receive either a corticosteroids or a saline injection, without them or the doctors performing the injection knowing which one was administered (double blind). If saline injections prove more effective, they could provide a less harmful and cheaper therapeutic alternative for TMO patients.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (TMO) is one of the most painful, disabling and prevalent hand osteoarthritis. One of the most common treatments for TMO is an intra-articular corticosteroids injection. However, non-superiority of corticosteroids injection over placebo to reduce pain has also been reported for TMO and other types of osteoarthritis (knee, hip, or shoulder). Furthermore, adverse effects of corticosteroids injection such as subcutaneous atrophy, tendon ruptures, and articular cartilage damage have been reported. Given the uncertain relevance of corticosteroids injection as a therapeutic agent, it becomes imperative to consider alternative options. In fact, three systematic reviews suggest that saline injections may be a viable option for TMO or knee pain.\n\nTo investigate the hypothesis that saline injection is a more effective modality than corticosteroids injection for the treatment of TMO in terms of reducing TMO pain and improving hand function, we must undertake a large, randomized trial in real clinical settings to ensure the acquisition of high-quality evidence. This pilot project is a preparatory phase for a larger study aimed at comparing the effectiveness of saline and corticosteroids injections in treating TMO, focusing on pain reduction and functional improvements. The study design is a pragmatic, multicenter, double-blind randomized trial, adhering to PRECIS-2 guidelines.\n\nThe pilot randomized controlled trial will assess the feasibility of a multicenter study by evaluating aspects such as recruitment capabilities, treatment adherence, and the success of blinding techniques for participants and clinicians. It will also identify potential challenges and gather preliminary data to support a funding application for the full-scale study. Recruitment and data collection are planned over a 12-month period, targeting 40 participants initially to refine procedures and validate the study's feasibility. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment, and the clinicians delivering the intervention will be blinded to the content of the injections. The study's primary outcome will measure pain intensity using a numeric scale at multiple time points, while secondary outcomes include upper limb functional limitations using the QuickDASH scale. These will be measured at baseline, before treatment, and at follow-up, 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment."

TNBC can be divided into at least two molecular entities; BRCA-like and non-BRCA-like. In this trial we would like to investigate whether a molecular subgroup exists within TNBCs that derives a benefit from atezolizumab added to first line chemotherapy.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Atezolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has shown activity in TNBC. Early clinical trials with anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy have shown that the median duration to response in TNBC is remarkably long (18 weeks) compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Since advanced TNBC is characterized by rapid disease progression, most patients with TNBC may not have the opportunity to derive benefit from immunotherapy. We hypothesize that by combining atezolizumab with paclitaxel or carboplatin-cyclophosphamide the desired rapid tumor control will be obtained with chemotherapy and subsequently atezolizumab can result in durable responses in a significant subset of patients. It is unknown whether addition of atezolizumab to first line chemotherapy in TNBC is more beneficial than adding this antibody to a second line treatment schedule. Because of this and because of the poor outcome of patients with advanced TNBC experiencing disease progression after first line palliative chemotherapy, patients who were randomized to a chemotherapy only arm in this study will be offered the opportunity to cross over to the other chemotherapy regimen plus atezolizumab at disease progression."

                    "briefSummary": "Background and Aim: Invasive procedures such as intravenous , intramuscular and subcutaneous Injection practices are among the most frequently performed nursing interventions in \u0131ntensive care units. However, although nursing interventions positively affect the clinical results of the patient, they can cause anxiety and pain. In recent years, music therapy and virtual reality, which are nonpharmacological methods, have been widely used in reducing pain and anxiety. Based on this information, this study was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental to evaluate the effects of virtual reality and music therapy on physiological parameters and anxiety in nursing \u0131nterventions applied to \u0131ntensive care patients.\n\nMethods:The research was conducted with 90 patient in intensive care unit. The patients in the sample group were randomly determined by the researcher as Control Group (Standard Procedure), Music Therapy Group and Virtual Reality Group. The selection of patients included in the study was made using a random number table. Research data were collected using a structured patient information form, VAS pain scale , and state and trait anxiety inventory.The data were analyzed using SPSS 25 program.\n\nKeywords: music therapy, virtual reality, nursing interventions, intensive care",
                    "detailedDescription": "This study was conducted as a Randomized Controlled Experimental to evaluate the Effects of Virtual Reality and Music Therapy on Physiological Parameters and Anxiety in Nursing Interventions Applied to Intensive Care Patients.\n\nHypotheses of the Research; H1 1 : Virtual Reality and Music Therapy Improve Physiological Parameters in Nursing Interventions Applied to Intensive Care Patients.\n\nH1 2 : Virtual Reality and Music Therapy in Nursing Interventions Applied to Intensive Care Patients reduces pain.\n\nH1 3 : Virtual Reality and Music Therapy reduce anxiety in Nursing Interventions Applied to Intensive Care Patients .\n\nVariables of the Research; The independent variables of the study are music therapy , virtual reality technology and standard procedure (explanation of the nursing intervention to the patient before the procedure).\n\nThe dependent variables of the study are the physiological parameters (pulse, blood pressure, fever, pain) and anxiety levels of the patients during nursing interventions.\n\nThe intensive care unit of a foundation university hospital between May 2022 and July 2022. In order to determine the number of patients constituting the research sample, a similar study (13) was taken as an example in the relevant literature and the power analysis G\\* Power 3.1 software was used. In this study, the sample size was calculated as 84, with 28 participants in each group, to reach a power level of 95% at a 0.5 effect size and 5% error level. Considering the high power of the test and the losses in the study , a total of 90 people were reached, 30 in each group. The patients in the sample group were randomly determined by the researcher as Control Group (Standard Procedure), Music Therapy Group and Virtual Reality Group. The selection of patients included in the study was made using a random number table. The randomization table was created by using the website http://stattrek.com/statistics/random-number-generator.aspx for randomization . As a result, the sample of the study consisted of 90 patients in total, 30 participants in each patient group, who were informed after the purpose of the study was explained and permission was obtained to participate in the study and who met the sample criteria of the study. The sample criteria were; the patient was over 18 years of age, had no visual or hearing impairment, had stable hemodynamic and physiological parameters (pulse, respiration, blood pressure, oxygen saturation , pain), was not intubated and volunteered for the study.Research data were collected using a structured patient information form, VAS pain scale , and state and trait anxiety inventory.application, the 3 groups of the study (control, virtual reality, music therapy ) were randomly assigned to 3 halls of the intensive care unit . Thus, the application was performed on one group of patients in one hall. All patients participating in the study filled out the \"Structured Patient Information Form\". Then, the patients were divided into 3 groups. The standard procedure (verbal procedure explanation) was applied to the control group patients. The virtual reality group patients were shown 3-dimensional videos with a relaxation effect using virtual glasses. The music therapy group patients were made to listen to the B\u00fcz\u00fcrk makam , a Turkish musical makam . In this study, while nursing interventions ( Intamuscular , Intravenous , Subcutaneous Injection) were applied to all 3 groups of patients, the physiological parameters (fever, pulse, blood pressure, respiration and oxygen saturation ), pain and anxiety levels of the patients were evaluated before and after the procedure .\n\nApplication in Control Group: Before the application of nursing interventions ( Intramuscular , Intravenous , Subcutaneous Injection) to the patients, the patients' physiological parameters (fever, pulse, blood pressure, respiration and oxygen saturation ), pain levels with VAS and anxiety levels with State- Trait Anxiety Scale were evaluated. Then , information was given about the nursing intervention to be performed as a standard procedure . The nursing intervention was applied. After the application, the patients' physiological parameters (fever, pulse, blood pressure, respiration and oxygen saturation ), pain levels with VAS and anxiety levels with State- Trait Anxiety Scale were evaluated. Whichever nursing intervention was necessary for the patients ( Intramuscular , Intravenous , Subcutaneous Injection), that application was applied. No unnecessary procedure was applied. After all the applications were completed, virtual glasses or music therapy was applied to the volunteers from the control group in order to ensure the principle of equality, which is one of the ethical principles .\n\nApplication in Music Therapy Group: Before the application of nursing interventions ( intramuscular , intravenous , subcutaneous injection) to the patients, the patients' physiological parameters (fever, pulse, blood pressure, respiration and oxygen saturation ), pain levels with VAS and anxiety levels with State -Trait Anxiety Scale were evaluated. During the nursing intervention, the patients were made to listen to B\u00fcz\u00fcrk makam, a Turkish musical makam. After the application, the patients' physiological parameters (fever, pulse, blood pressure, respiration and oxygen saturation ), pain levels with VAS and anxiety levels with State -Trait Anxiety Scale were evaluated. Whichever nursing intervention was necessary ( intramuscular , intravenous , subcutaneous injection), that application was performed on the patients . No unnecessary procedure was performed.\n\nApplication in Virtual Reality Group: Before the application of nursing interventions ( Intamuscular , Intravenous , Subcutaneous Injection) to the patients, the patients' physiological parameters (fever, pulse, blood pressure, respiration and oxygen saturation ), pain levels with VAS and anxiety levels with State -Trait Anxiety Scale were evaluated. During the nursing intervention, the patients watched 3D videos with relaxation effect with virtual glasses. After the application, the patients' physiological parameters (fever, pulse, blood pressure, respiration and oxygen saturation ), pain levels with VAS and anxiety levels with State -Trait Anxiety Scale were evaluated. Whichever nursing intervention was necessary ( Intamuscular , Intravenous , Subcutaneous Injection), that application was performed on the patients . No unnecessary procedure was performed.\n\nEthical considerations Before starting the research, permission was obtained from the Istanbul Beykent University Social and Human Sciences Scientific Research and Publication Ethics Board with the decision number 223 dated 09.05.2022. Written permission was obtained from the institution where the research was conducted. After the information about the research, the patients who agreed to participate voluntarily were asked to read and sign the consent forms prepared for each group. The researcher, who completed the application phase of the research, is a faculty member in the Department of Nursing Fundamentals.\n\nData analysis The data obtained in the study were obtained using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences ) for Windows 25.0 program was used for analysis. Descriptive statistical methods were used for data evaluation as number, percentage, mean, standard deviation. Differences between proportions of categorical variables in independent groups were analyzed using Chi-Square and Fisher It was analyzed with exact tests. T-test was used to compare quantitative continuous data between two independent groups. Dependent groups t-test was used to compare within-group measurements."

The objective is to determine the effectiveness of this test in accurately measuring the functional abilities of individuals with traumatic meniscus tears. By focusing on patients who have been diagnosed with such injuries and employing the two-minute step test, the study aims to provide valuable insights into the suitability of this evaluation tool for assessing functional capacity in this specific patient population. The findings of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the clinical understanding and management of traumatic meniscal tears, offering clinicians a reliable and valid method for evaluating the functional capabilities of affected individuals.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The study is planned as a cross-sectional clinical study. Fifty-five patients diagnosed with traumatic meniscal tear who apply to the Istanbul Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital clinics will be included in the study. Patients must have a previous diagnosis of traumatic meniscal tear based on magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nSociodemographic data such as age, height, weight, body mass index, marital status, education level, and occupation will be recorded. The level of impairment in daily activities of patients with meniscal tear will be assessed using the Western Ontario Meniscus Evaluation Questionnaire. Pain intensity will be evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale, a linear scale of 10 cm. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale will be used to assess the patient's level of distress due to pain. The patient's confidence level in performing different activities due to pain will be evaluated using the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire.\n\nThe patient's physical function will be assessed using the 2-Minute StepTest. This test, to be administered by the same evaluator, requires the patient to have rested for at least 30 minutes before starting, and there will be a minimum of 1 hour of rest between the tests conducted. Before starting the tests, the patient's blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate will be measured, and if results are outside the normal range, the test will not proceed."
