                    "briefSummary": "In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the gastric antrum with ultrasound and compare gastric volumes in diabetic and non-diabetic pregnant women in the standard fasting state before surgery. The primary aim was qualitative assessment, while secondary objectives included quantitative assessment, comparing gastric volume, aspiration risk, and the effect of preoperative anxiety on stomach contents.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Food residues in the stomach of patients scheduled for surgery are a major risk factor for pulmonary aspiration, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. This risk is particularly critical in pregnant women who may require surgery without proper fasting. National guidelines recommend fasting for 6 hours for solid foods, 4 hours for breast milk, and 2 hours for clear liquids. These guidelines apply equally to adults and children. Pregnant patients scheduled for elective surgery follow the same fasting rules as non-pregnant patients.\n\nGastroparesis, defined as delayed gastric emptying without mechanical obstruction, affects 30-50% of diabetic (DM) patients. Ultrasound measurement of the gastric antral area can help identify whether the stomach is full in symptomatic patients. Gastric ultrasound is a valuable tool for assessing aspiration risk in pregnant women, especially during emergency surgeries, and has shown promise in fasting non-pregnant patients scheduled for elective surgery.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the gastric antrum using ultrasound and compare gastric volumes in diabetic and non-diabetic pregnant women in a standard fasting state before surgery. The primary goal was qualitative assessment, with secondary objectives including quantitative assessment, comparing gastric volume, aspiration risk, and the effect of preoperative anxiety on stomach contents."

Vaccines made from DNA may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells that express HCV infection.",

To determine the safety profile of the HCV DNA vaccine, consisting of INO-8000 (HCV antigen DNA) alone or co-administered with INO-9012 (interleukin \\[IL\\]-12 adjuvant DNA) (DNA plasmid encoding interleukin-12 INO-9012).\n\nII. To identify a dose of INO-9012 (IL-12 adjuvant DNA) for co-administration with INO-8000 (HCV antigen DNA) based on induction of HCV-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 26 weeks compared to baseline in HCV-infected participants.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces a \\> 1 log decrease (or undetectable) in HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) level at weeks 14 and 26.\n\nII. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces an end-of-treatment undetectable HCV RNA (end-of-treatment virologic response - EVR) at 26 weeks and a sustained virologic response (SVR) at 36 weeks.\n\nIII. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces other parameters of cluster of differentiation (CD)8 and CD4 T lymphocyte responses as measured by flow cytometry, and antibody responses to HCV antigen at weeks 14 and 26.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of INO-9012.\n\nPatients receive INO-8000 intramuscularly (IM) and DNA plasmid encoding interleukin-12 INO-9012 IM (dose levels 2-4) followed by electroporation (EP) at day 0 and at weeks 4, 12, and 24.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 48 and 76."

alternatively, proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives and certain intrauterine devices or two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of \\< 1% per year (barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide)\n  * Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately\n  * Should a female partner of a male study participant become pregnant while the male participant is on study, the male participant should inform his study physician immediately\n* Willingness to avoid excessive use of alcohol during the study; note: excessive use is defined as drinking \\>= 8 alcoholic drinks per week on average\n* Willingness to provide blood samples for research tests specified in the protocol\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* REGISTRATION INCLUSION CRITERIA\n* Serum or plasma HCV RNA level \\>= 10,000 IU/mL\n* Screening HCV genotype, demonstrating genotype 1\n* Alpha feto protein (AFP) levels within normal institutional limits or judged to be not clinically significant by the investigator; Exception: If deemed clinically significant, then liver imaging must be available within previous 6 months (e.g., ultrasound, computed tomography \\[CT\\] scan, magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\]) showing no evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1\n* Screening laboratory values (serum chemistry, hematology, prothrombin time \\[PT\\](international normalized ratio \\[INR\\])/activated partial thromboplastin time \\[APTT\\], and creatine phosphokinase \\[CPK\\]) obtained up to 45 days prior to administration of first vaccine injection on day 0 within institutional normal range or judged to be not clinically significant by principal investigator (PI) and medical monitor\n* 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showing normal heart rhythm; note: if there are abnormalities, then the abnormalities must be deemed of no clinical significance\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* PRE-REGISTRATION EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n* Failure of previous HCV therapies\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n* Any previous treatment for HCV =\\< 6 months prior to registration\n* Other uncontrolled immune-compromising illness\n* Autoimmune disorders, transplant recipients, other immunosuppression including any concurrent condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating agents; Exception: eye drop-containing and infrequent inhaled corticosteroids are permissible; topical corticosteroids are permissible at locations other than the administration site (upper arm); Note: All systemic corticosteroids must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to randomization; inhaled corticosteroids must be discontinued \\>= 48 hours prior to randomization and courses of more than 2 weeks are not permissible within 4 weeks of randomization\n* Ongoing hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection\n* Documented evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis (Metavir 2, 3, and 4) and subjects with significant extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C (such as cryoglobulinemia with symptoms or evidence of end-organ manifestations, renal disease, type 2 diabetes, or porphyria cutanea tarda\n* Other known causes of significant liver disease including chronic or acute hepatitis B, acute hepatitis A, hemochromatosis, or homozygote alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\n* Active malignancy; exception: non-melanoma skin cancers cancer(s) for which diagnosis and treatment was completed \\>= 3 years prior to pre-registration\n* History of major organ transplantation with an existing functional graft\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* History of cardiac arrhythmia, controlled or uncontrolled, including ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmia\n* Pregnant or nursing women; Note: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because INO-8000 has an unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with this DNA vaccine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with INO-8000\n* Current diagnosis or history of cardiac pre-excitation syndromes (e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White)\n* Metal implants on same limb as intended administration site\n* Tattoos, scars, active lesions, or rashes =\\< 2 cm of the intended site of study treatment\n* Documentation of history of seizure within previous 5 years\n* Pacemaker or other implanted device\n* Any condition that, in the clinical judgement of the investigator, would place a participant at unreasonably increased risk\n* REGISTRATION EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n* Receiving any other investigational agents =\\< 6 months prior to Registration\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to INO-8000 and INO-9012",

                    "briefSummary": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a group of primary cutaneous lymphomas including Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS). SS is characterized by erythroderma and high numbers of circulating atypical lymphocytes (S\u00e9zary cells. SCs). Blood staging was added to the Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) classification of MF/SS, reflecting the broad spectrum of CTCLs and the poor prognosis related to blood involvement. Blood classes were defined using blood-smear manual counts. However, this method never reached an international consensus status because of its subjective nature and its poor sensitivity. Several markers have been identified with variable efficiency for MF/SS diagnosis, outcome prediction and blood response to treatment. Such markers are essential for sharing and publishing consistent data about diagnosis, staging, prognosis and response to therapies. The detection of SCs is based on the lack of pan T-cell markers such as CD7 and/or CD26, which is not constant and may be observed in benign dermatoses. Thus, patients are often diagnosed with a delay, even treated with inappropriate therapies which worsens their prognosis. The relevance of blood-class in MF/SS is not only related to stage but also contributes to the response to therapy in clinical trials. We found that a significant proportion of benign T-cells from SS patients are CD4+CD26-, which may underestimate the rate of complete response to treatment. The identification of KIR3DL2 on SCs by our team has greatly helped the detailed study of the malignant clone. We have recently published two ancillary studies demonstrating the specificity and reliability of KIR3DL2 as a positive marker for SCs, and its prognosis value at initial diagnosis. We have designed an optimized flow-cytometry strategy as part of the routine care of erythrodermic patients at Saint-Louis Hospital and published in 2019 the results of a 5 years prospective single-center study involving 254 CTCL patients at initial diagnosis. We provided recommendations with the use a threshold value of KIR3DL2+SCs \u2265 200/\u00b5L or KIR3DL2+SCs/lymphocytes \u2265 10% in the diagnostic criteria and proposed a novel algorithm blood staging.\n\nSeveral innovative immunotherapies in phase I/II trials or under compassionate use are ongoing in French centers, with the need to assess blood response using positive markers. Our goal is to validate KIR3DL2 as a specific marker for SS and to assess its reliability for blood staging and response to treatment in a multicenter study (11 centers)."

It will also assess the safety and overall surgical outcomes when using Xperience\u2122 compared to povidone-iodine.\n\nMain Questions the Study Aims to Answer:\n\n* Does the use of Xperience\u2122 decrease the incidence of surgical site infections compared to povidone-iodine?\n* What are the differences in the rates of premature implant removal due to infection between patients treated with Xperience\u2122 and those treated with povidone-iodine?\n* Are there fewer post-surgical complications with Xperience\u2122 compared to povidone-iodine?\n\nStudy Design:\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either Xperience\u2122 or a dilute povidone-iodine solution during their bilateral implant-based breast reconstruction. Only the research team will know which irrgiation is given- the participant will not know.\n\nParticipant Will:\n\n* Undergo the surgical procedure using one of the two irrigation solutions.\n* Receive regular post-operative check-ups to monitor for signs of infection and other complications.\n* Have data collected on any post-surgical complications, the necessity for early implant removal, and overall surgical outcomes."

The investigational sites chosen to participate in this study will be trained on the insertion procedure using plastic fistula cannulas according to established curriculum. A combination of didactic training followed by insertion using a cannulation arm will be conducted. Cannulation on consented subjects will begin after the inserter demonstrates proficiency on the cannulation arm. Proficiency definitions are outlined in the protocol. After two supervised (by Medtronic and/or dedicated, trained super user) successful cannulations on consented subjects, the clinician will be permitted to cannulate without supervision.\n\nData supporting the primary, secondary, and exploratory objectives will be captured following thirty-six (36) hemodialysis sessions for each enrolled subject.\n\nCannulations will be performed by a minimum of five different clinicians at up to 5 dialysis clinic sites.\n\nThe investigational sites chosen to participate in this study will be trained on the insertion procedure using plastic fistula cannulas for a pre-determined period and according to established curriculum. A combination of didactic training followed by insertion using a cannulation arm will be conducted. After two supervised (by Medtronic and/or dedicated, trained super user) successful cannulations on consented subjects, the clinician will be permitted to cannulate without supervision and the data collection for the primary and secondary objectives will begin. Hemodialysis sessions will be performed, according to the investigator's prescription, throughout the duration of the study. Dialysis adequacy will be verified at baseline and during the mid-week session on weeks 1, 3, 6 and 12. Other than the blood sampling, there are no study-specific procedures, other than cannulation with the Argyle\u2122 Safety Fistula Cannula with Anti-Reflux Valve, that will be required."
