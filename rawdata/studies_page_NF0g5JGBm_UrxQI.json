                    "briefSummary": "Patients with relapsed medulloblastoma, ependymoma and ATRT have a very poor prognosis whether treated with conventional chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, irradiation or combinations of these modalities. Antiangiogenetic therapy has emerged as new treatment option in solid malignancies. The frequent, metronomic schedule targets both proliferating tumor cells and endothelial cells, and minimizes toxicity. In this study the investigators will evaluate the use of biweekly intravenous bevacizumab in combination with five oral drugs (thalidomide, celecoxib, fenofibrate, and alternating cycles of daily low-dose oral etoposide and cyclophosphamide), augmented with alternating courses of intrathecal etoposide and cytarabine. The aim of the study is to extend therapy options for children with recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma, ependymoma and ATRT, for whom no known curative therapy exists, by prolonging survival while maintaining good quality of life. The primary objective of the MEMMAT trial is to evaluate the activity of this multidrug antiangiogenic approach in these heavily pretreated children and young adults. Additionally, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), as well as feasibility and toxicity will be examined."

                    "briefSummary": "This study is designed to develop a cohort of individuals without pancreatic cancer, but who are at increased risk of developing it due to family history or genetic predisposition. These high-risk individuals will be asked to provide baseline and annual (serial) follow-up blood samples for the duration of the study funding. Mayo Clinic is part of a national Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC)\\[1\\] which aims to establish a high-risk cohort with the goal of validating blood biomarkers (discovered/developed outside of this protocol) using the samples collected serially (annually) that predict or detect pancreatic cancer prior to clinical diagnosis.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The high mortality rate of pancreatic cancer is primarily due to the advanced stage at diagnosis in the majority of cases. The five-year survival rate for this cancer is only 9%, the poorest survival rate of any major cancer, making pancreatic cancer the third leading cancer killer that affects both men and women in the United States. Five-year survival can be improved if the cancer is detected earlier.\\[2\\] It is thus important to apply cancer genetics, risk assessment, and early detection that can identify a population of high-risk individuals who can benefit from early detection.\n\nA key strategy for effective early detection research in pancreatic cancer is to identify and build longitudinal high-risk cohorts and maintain data from baseline to follow up, and biobanking of repeated (annual) non-invasive biospecimen collections. The research to be performed would compare samples of participants who develop cancer over time compared to those who do not. Tests that would be applied to the biospecimen collections would use subsets of participants in designs that would provide the maximum amount of information about the performance of the assays in predicting who has cancer at an early stage \\[3,4\\].\n\nThe collection of biosamples and data for the family-based biobank resource/registry proposed here is partially funded by NCI funded U01 grants, through the PCDC \\[1\\]. At Mayo Clinic, NCI grant U01 CA210138 is the funding source. The PCDC is committed to developing a longitudinal cohort (registry) of individuals and family members currently without pancreatic cancer, but who are at high risk due to family history of pancreatic cancer or predisposition gene mutation status. High-risk individuals will be recruited at each site, and biospecimens will be logged, stored, administered, and studied by consensus protocols of members of the PCDC. The maintenance of protocols will be maintained by the PCDC Administrative Core at Mayo Clinic. The PCDC cohort will require a long-term investment and will be most successful with multiple contributing sites."

Then they will be directed to interact with a chatbot designed to deliver personalized HPV vaccine messages (tailored to the participant's personality) or a similar chatbot with non-personalized messages. There will also be a control condition where participants will see the brief CDC message about HPV vaccine but will not interact with any chatbot. All participants will answer questions related to their attitudes toward HPV vaccination, intentions to vaccinate their children, as well as other message response measures."

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if buprenorphine can be started for opioid use disorder with fentanyl use without requiring or precipitating opioid withdrawal. To be eligible, participants must have moderate or severe opioid use disorder and must have fentanyl detected on a urine drug test.\n\nParticipants will be admitted to a monitored research unit for the trial. They will be randomized to start buprenorphine with either standard initiation or with a new approach called rapid outpatient low-dose initiation (ROLDI).\n\nFor standard initiation, participants will be instructed to arrive to the unit with at least 8 hours since last fentanyl use. Once they have at least moderately severe opioid withdrawal (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale \\[COWS\\] 11 or higher), participants will receive 2 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, and then 8 mg sublingual buprenorphine, with doses every 2 hours. They will then continue 8-12 mg twice daily. This is the current standard of care.\n\nFor ROLDI, participants will not be required to have a period abstinence, they will have no or minimal withdrawal (COWS 4 or less) when starting buprenorphine, and participants will take 0.5 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1 mg, 1 mg, and then 4 mg sublingual buprenorphine with dosing every two hours. They will then continue 8-12 mg twice daily.\n\nThe main aim of this clinical trial is to assess whether ROLDI is safe, feasible, acceptable to patients, and worthwhile to study in a larger trial. The secondary aim is to describe fentanyl and norfentanyl pharmacokinetics (that is to say, fentanyl and norfentanyl concentration in blood and urine) during early abstinence to understand why some people using fentanyl develop precipitated withdrawal with standard initiation."

Nevertheless, it may be difficult in cases of retinal hemorrhage, small tumor size or atypical presentation. The study of microvascular flow (Superb Microvascular Imaging, SMI) of intraocular tumors could improve the confidence of differential diagnosis when evaluating these suspicious lesions, or even determine whether a lesion is benign or malignant by describing the vascularization of the lesion.\n\nThe investigators propose to study the microvascular flow patterns of intraocular tumors prior to proton therapy.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The ultrasound equipment available in ophthalmology does not have Doppler technology and does not allow the study of the vascularization and microvascularization of intraocular lesions. The interest in the system used in this study is to import SMI into ophthalmology to study tumor microvascularization. The study of tumor vascularization can help in the differential diagnosis and follow-up of tumors, and therefore can impact the management of patients with tumors."

If no sebum is present, there is no nutritional source for the c. acnes, the bacteria die, and acne resolves. A newly FDA approved acne medication consisting of clascoterone cream 1% is believed to effectively treat acne due to a decrease in sebum production. This mechanism of action has been postulated based on efficacy observed in the phase III trials that lead to its approval. This research aims to demonstrate the effect of clascoterone cream 1% in sebum reduction."

                    "detailedDescription": "Introduction\n\nInborn errors of immunity (IEIs) are generally considered to be rare monogenic disorders of the immune system that cause immunodeficiency, autoinflammation, autoimmunity, allergy and/or cancer (1). IEIs are a group of diseases comprised of more than 450 IEIs, and they are becoming more prevalent (2). Although IEIs are rare diseases, they are more common than previously thought, following the use of modern diagnostic methods. A recent evaluation indicated that at least 1-2% of the world's population are affected by IEIs (3). Several warning signs have been developed to increase physician awareness about the early signs that can help to diagnosis IEIs. Warning signs of IEIs were developed by an institution called the Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF) (4,5). the ten warning signs are four or more new ear infections within 1 year,two or more serious sinus infections within 1 year,two or more months on antibiotics with little effect,two or more pneumonias within 1 year,failure of an infant to gain weight or grow normally,recurrent, deep skin or organ abscesses, persistent thrush in mouth or fungal infection on skin, need for intravenous antibiotics to clear infections,Two or more deep-seated infections including septicemia and family history of IEIs. (6). The International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) has classified IEIs into nine categories based upon the segment of the immune system that is affected, plus a 10th category of IEIs phenocopies. Each category is characterized by unique types of infections and clinical features that are useful for the selection of initial appropriate laboratory evaluation to help with diagnosis (7). The mechanisms that explain the increased susceptibility of IEIs patients to the development of tumours are multiple and different in the various pathologies. The most common process is the reduction of cell-mediated immunosurveillance, which plays a fundamental role in protecting against tumours (8,9). Several pathways, such as genomic instability, overstimulation of immune cells, viral infection and chronic inflammation, have been proposed to explain the increased incidence of malignancy among patients with IEIs (10). Moreover, defective dendritic cells (DCs) differentiation and function, which affect the initiation and development of T cell responses, have been associated with cancer development (11) The diagnostic investigation of IEIs should be guided by the clinical characterization of patients, aiming to optimize the use of complementary tests. Many diagnoses are attained only through genetic tests, which are not always available. However, the absence of a diagnosis of certainty should never delay the implementation of therapeutic measures that preserve patient life and health (12). Major advances in the treatment of these disorders have occurred over the last half-century, and deeper molecular understanding of many disorders combined with clinically available genetic testing is allowing for use of precision therapy for several IEIs. Patients with antibody deficiencies who rely on immunoglobulin replacement therapy now have many treatment options with products that are much safer and better tolerated compared to the past (13). Steroids are often used as an initial therapy but have serious long-term complications. Targeted immune therapies, such as cytokine or small molecule inhibitors, are increasingly available with the advantage of fewer global immune suppressive effects. However, patients with IEIs often do not have an adequate clinical response to immunosuppressive treatment, resulting in referral for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as a potentially curative therapy (14,15)."

                    "detailedDescription": "What would taking part involve?\n\nFirst, we would like to talk with a group of patients (between 6 to 20) about the impact of cardiac sarcoidosis in their quality of life during an interview. We will review and analysed these interviews. Then, we will compare with what is already know about cardiac sarcoidosis and its impact on quality of life. Also, we will ask healthcare professionals working with cardiac sarcoidosis patients to review our results. Finally, we will use this information to create the first draft of the new questionnaire (CARD-SARC questionnaire)to measure quality of life in cardiac sarcoidosis patients.\n\nSecond, we will ask 20 patients with cardiac sarcoidosis to complete the draft version of the CARD-SARC questionnaire. Also, they will complete validated quality of life questionnaires (for general population or sarcoidosis patients) and questionnaires that explore potential symptoms of fatigue, anxiety and depression. We will compare an review these results to confirm that the CARD-SARC questionnaire is ready for evaluation.\n\nThird, we will ask 100 cardiac sarcoidosis patients to complete the CARD-SARC questionnaire and the validated questionnaires (for quality of life and potential sarcoidosis symptoms) to evaluate how good the CARD-SARC is at measuring quality of life changes in cardiac sarcoidosis patients.\n\nHow will patients or the public help guide the research?\n\nThis work has been influenced and designed with people living with cardiac sarcoidosis. SarcoidosisUK, the UK sarcoidosis charity, has been supportive and engaged on this work. Likewise, five expert patients with cardiac sarcoidosis have also agreed to lead, contribute and advice on relevant aspects of the study, and to participate sharing the results to the public, patients and professional groups."
