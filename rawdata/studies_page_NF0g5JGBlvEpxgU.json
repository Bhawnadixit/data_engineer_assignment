                    "briefSummary": "Precision medicine is defined as \"an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person\" by the Precision Medicine Initiative.\n\nPatients have different response to different treatment modalities, and sore/pain medicine is no exception. In our experience, low-level laser (LLL), ultrasound, and prolotherapy can reduce sore /pain through different genetic pathway. Whether the therapeutic effect is controlled by the genetic variants of those sore /pain related genes or not, is still in debate. The aims of this study are (1) To set up next generation sequencing (NGS)-based approach to find genetic variants which can determine the response of sng/pain treatment modalities and the phenotype of idiopathic scoliosis. (2) To find possible metabolomics and proteomic markers of sng/pain. (3) To determine the algorithm of precision medicine for sng/pain control via the genetic markers.\n\nInvestigators will recruit 80 myofascial pain participant and 80 idiopathic scoliosis participant from Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Taiwan University Hospital Bei-Hu Branch in 2023 and 2025. The myofascial pain participant participants will receive LLL, ultrasound, and prolotherapy, and the therapeutic effect will be recorded. The clinical trial will evaluate the Sng / pain (VAS) and muscle tone of the idiopathic scoliosis participant. The blood and urine samples from the first, the second, and the third visits will be analyzed by next generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry to find the possible biomarker in 2024 and 2025. Investigators expect to develop the individualized treatment plan by means of these biomarkers. Hopefully, the results will be widely applied in the field of sore /pain medicine.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Precision medicine is defined as \"an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person\" by the Precision Medicine Initiative.\n\nPain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\" by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP).Traditionally, soreness, or sng, is also included as one of the pain sensation. Recently, the investigators defined sngception as acid and/or soreness sensation in the somatosensory system, and revealed that analgesia in muscle is through substance P and Tac1.\n\nAccording to the clinical outcome, some patients responded to physical agents well, and some preferred injections. The genetic variants of the above-mentioned genes might be the determining factors of differential therapeutic effects. However, it took about 4-8 weeks for a patient to switch from one treatment option to another one. If the investigators can determine the optimal treatment modality by genetic biomarkers, the treatment course and total expanse will decrease a lot.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that the genetic variants of the proposed genes (TRPV1, ASIC1a, ASIC3, Tac1, COMT, TCL1A, POMC, RGS4, ASIC2, ASIC4, TRPA1, NK1R, G2A, GPR4, OGR1, TDAG8, TASK1, TASK2, TASK3, TREK1, P2X2, P2X3, P2X5, TRPV4, KCNK1, NTSR1, NTSR2, CaV3.2, Nav1.1, Piezo1, and Piezo2, Runx3 or Egr3, endothelin converting enzyme-like 1 (ECEL1), myosin heavy chain genes MYH3 and MYH8, myosin-binding protein C gene, MYBPC1, and TNNI2, TNNT3 and TPM2 that encode the muscle regulatory proteins troponin I, troponin T and beta-tropomyosin) could be the prognostic biomarkers of sng/pain treatments or proprioceptive function.\n\n1.Specific Aims\n\n1. To set up next generation sequencing (NGS)-based approach to find genetic variants which can determine the response of sng/pain treatment modalities and the phenotype of idiopathic scoliosis.\n2. To find possible metabolomics and proteomic markers of sng/pain.\n3. To determine the algorithm of precision medicine for sng/pain control via the genetic markers.\n\n2.In the past years, our team had some achievements to justify the search of genetic variants for development of a new sore/pain treatment algorithm.\n\n1. Analgesia of LLLT is through TRPV1.\n2. Analgesia by therapeutic ultrasound is through ASIC3.\n3. Dextrose injection decreased chronic muscle pain through ASIC1a.\n4. Biomarker for sng/pain in fibromyalgia.\n\n3.Study design\n\n(1) Participants from cohort A-Myofascial pain syndrome: The investigators will recruit 80 participant from National Taiwan University Hospital and its Branch hospital.\n\nB. Clinical trail design:\n\n1. After obtaining the informed consent, the basic demographic data, including age, gender, job, education level, and past medical history of eligible participant are collected.\n2. The eligible participant first received LLLT with a 685-nm wavelength and an output of 30 mW at energy densities of 8 J/cm2 at trigger point of upper trapezius muscle. The pre- and post-treatment VAS-pain and VAS-sng are collected for LLLT phenotype determination, respectively.\n3. Then, they are conveniently assigned into two groups (40 subjects in each group): A. therapeutic ultrasound group; B. prolotherapy group. Group A receives therapeutic ultrasound. Group B receives hypertonic prolotherapy at perimysium of upper trapezius muscle. No other medication or physical modality was given to avoid efficacy interference in both groups.\n4. The recruited participant receive evaluation before and after injection, and 2-week after injection. The primary outcome is VAS-pain and VAS-sng. The secondary outcomes are pain threshold, muscle tone, and SF-36. Venous blood and urine samples were collected at first visit and 2-week visit, respectively. The buffy coat is separated after centrifugation, and stored as well. The urine samples were aliquoted and stored at -80 \u00baC in a locked freezer for future analysis.\n5. Rescue therapy (cross-over treatment): If the participant does not satisfy with their first round treatment and the improvement of VAS is less than 10, then they are eligible to receive the rescue therapy-the treatment in the other group. And they will return to clinic for another 2 weeks. The outcome variables will be collected in the 3rd visit as well.\n\n(2) Participants from cohort B-idiopathic scoliosis: The investigators will recruit 80 participant from National Taiwan University Hospital and its Branch hospital, and Taichung Veteran Hospital.\n\nB. Clinical Trail design:\n\n1. After obtaining the informed consent, the basic demographic data, including age, gender, job, education level, physical activity level, and past medical history of eligible participant are collected.\n2. The recruited participant receive evaluation for once only. The collected parameters include Cobb's angle, spine rotational angle, VAS-pain and VAS-sng, strength and tone of paraspinal muscle, and SF-36. Venous blood and urine samples were also collected.\n\nData analyses will be performed as previously described. Briefly, the raw sequencing data will be aligned to the reference human genome (Feb. 2009, GRCh37/hg19) using BWA-MEM. The investigators will use Picard to perform necessary data conversion, sorting and indexing. The main variant calling process, for both single nucleotide variants and indels, will be operated with the GATK software package. Structural variants will also be identified. The investigators will apply ANNOVAR to appropriately annotate the genetic variants; this include at least gene annotation, amino acid change annotation, SIFT scores, PolyPhen2 score, dbSNP identifiers, 1000 Genome Project allele frequencies, gnomAD allele frequencies and ClinVar database with variant clinical significance. The investigators will then use IGV to view the mapping and annotation of sequences on a graphic interface.\n\nThe allele frequencies of variants of interest will be compared between different groups of participants. The investigators will look for possible rare variants with very strong effects (the single-gene model) as well as relatively common variants with moderate to strong effects (the complex phenotype model)."

New technologies in PET/CT scanners can allow cheaper and more sensitive exams with low radiation exposure. AI can be used to denoise LDCT to enhance the accuracy of imaging tests and build riskassessment models. This project aims to develop a new approach exploiting both these revolutionary advancements to bridge the existing gap in lung cancer screening. Patients in a high-risk population will be enrolled into two different cohorts undergoing LDCT scan and simultaneous \\[18F\\]FDG PET/CT on new-generation long axial field of view scanner (UO1) or screening with low LDCT only (UO2). AI will assist in image enhancement and interpretation and will develop a personalised risk-model guiding the following steps of clinical management, significantly improving early diagnosis of lung cancer, reducing mortality and healthcare costs.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Assessment of the potential added value of low dose \\[18F\\]FDG PET/CT in the early detection of lung cancer in the screening work-up of the high-risk population. The target population (cohort 1) for the multimodal screening programme will be identified at UO1 on the basis of the PLCOM2012 prediction risk model. All patients enrolled in cohort 1 will undergo a LDCT and a simultaneous low dose \\[18F\\]FDG PET scan. Whole body \\[18F\\]FDG PET/CT will be performed according to EANM Guidelines for tumour imaging. Briefly, patients will be instructed to fast for 6 hours and to avoid strenuous physical activity for 48 hours prior to the PET/CT scan. Diabetic patients will be instructed to fast for 4 hours prior to the scan and will be instructed on the use of medications according to the institution's protocol. Blood glucose levels will be checked, \\[18F\\]FDG will be injected intravenously, and PET/CT images will be acquired after 60 minutes (\u00b1 10 minutes). A new generation long axial field of view PET/CT scanner (Omni Legend, General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) will be used for whole body imaging.\n\nThe control population (cohort 2) will be identified in UO2 on the basis of the PLCOM2012 prediction risk model as previously described for cohort 1. The LDCT scan will be performed in single deep inspiratory breath hold. No intravenous contrast will be administered. LDCT images will be assessed and interpreted by at least two experienced radiologists. LDCT will be defined as positive if at least one non-calcified lung nodule \\>5 mm in any diameter is detected. LDCT will be defined as negative if no clinically significant morphological alterations are detected. Non-calcified nodules of 3-5mm detected by LDCT will be reported. Lung-RADS criteria will be used to classify detected lung nodules. Any other suspicious morphological alteration will be reported. The number, size, characteristics, and location of any lesion detected will be recorded for each LDCT scan. Any abnormality suggestive of clinically significant conditions other than cancer will be also reported. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy will be calculated by per-patient and per-lesion analysis."

Participants will be screened for up to 28 days prior to investigational product (IP) administration on Day 1. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 and will be residential for a single period of six days/five nights. On Day 1, participants will receive a single oral dose of ASP0367 under fasting conditions followed by a 96-hour in-house blood and urine sampling period. Participants are to remain semirecumbent for four hours postdose. Standard safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on Day 5 on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit.\n\nThe study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place five to nine days after the last pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at the time of early discontinuation from the study."

                    "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of new cancer genetic counseling models that aim to increase patient engagement with the genetics team. To do this, the study consists of two trials to evaluate two related interventions. The first trial is the EfFORT Trial, which evaluates a cascade genetic testing intervention. Cascade testing is the process of offering genetic testing to people who are at risk of having inherited a possibly harmful gene change that has been found in their family. The study will look at how often genetic testing occurs when healthcare providers have permission to reach out to family members to recommend genetic testing and to help those who are interested get tested. The study will look at whether this cascade testing intervention is practical and effective. The study would like to see how this approach of healthcare providers reaching out directly to family members compares with the usual approach of patients telling their family members about the recommendation to get genetic testing. The second trial is the STRIVE Trial, which evaluates an intervention designed to help patients who receive an uncertain result from genetic testing (also called a \"variant of uncertain significance\") stay connected with their genetics care team, and to help patients and their primary care providers stay up-to-date about the meaning of uncertain genetic test results. The study will look at whether an intervention that consists of a study online portal for patients with uncertain genetic test results and their primary care providers will help them to stay up-to-date on the meaning of uncertain genetic test results. The study would like to see how this intervention compares to the usual approach of encouraging patients to re-contact their genetics care team on their own about a year after getting genetic testing.\""

The management recommendations of fibromyalgia issued by the European Union, Canada, Germany and Israel have all affirmed the \"first-line\" role of Non-pharmaceutical therapy. Because of its good efficacy and safety, acupuncture therapy has been recommended in the management guidelines and has broad application prospects. Warm acupuncture is a therapy combining acupuncture and moxibustion, which is widely used in the treatment of various painful diseases in China, especially for cold-sensitive patients . This study aims to observe the safety and effectiveness of warm acupuncture in the treatment of cold-sensitive fibromyalgia patients, in order to provide a more alternative non-drug therapy for this particular type of patients with fibromyalgia ."
