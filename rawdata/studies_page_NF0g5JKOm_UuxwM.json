                    "detailedDescription": "Meniscus tears are one of the most common sports-related injuries. Acute trauma-related tears are more common in active young individuals and athletes. Symptoms such as pain, effusion, tenderness at the joint line, locking, and knee dysfunction are observed after injury. It is aimed to provide painless movement, normal knee kinematics, and retaining of muscle strength in rehabilitation process. Anti-gravity treadmills use an inflatable space around the lower extremities and significantly reduce body weight during walking and running. Anti-gravity treadmill training protects the joint and surrounding soft tissues against the negative effects of loading during the post-injury recovery process, and allows the tissues to heal safely. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of anti-gravity treadmill training on symptoms and functions in patients with meniscus tears.\n\nPatients will be randomly divided into three groups: Anti-Gravity Treadmill Group, Conventional Treadmill Group, and Control Group. All patients will be included physiotherapy and rehabilitation program for 6 weeks, 2 days a week. While subjects in the Anti-Gravity Treadmill Group will participate to training anti-gravity treadmill walking, subjects in the Conventional Treadmill Group will participate walking program on a standard treadmill. Symptoms and functions will be assessed baseline and after 6-week program."

                    "briefSummary": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants and young children. It is also a leading cause of mortality in children \\<5 years of age worldwide. Until recently, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines were available to prevent RSV infection. The only prophylactic product for RSV prevention recommended for infants was the monoclonal antibody palivizumab, but administration was limited to those with extreme prematurity, chronic lung disease, or hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. However, in 2023, the FDA approved two products designed to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in all infants: an active RSV vaccine based on the prefusion F protein (RSVpreF, ABRYSVO, Pfizer) administered during pregnancy, and a passive, long-acting monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab-alip \\[henceforth referred to as nirsevimab\\], BEYFORTUS, AstraZeneca) administered to infants at birth or at the start of their first RSV season. Both products were evaluated in Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials and have high efficacy in preventing LRTD caused by RSV in infants. Although there is no established correlate of protection against RSV, antibodies have been associated with protection across multiple studies. The clinical development plan for the products did not include comprehensive evaluations of the magnitude and durability of the immune response, nor were the two products tested in a single trial. This study is a prospective, randomized, open-label Phase 4 study with the primary objective of evaluating the magnitude and durability of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies in infants through 12 months of life following either maternal RSV vaccination, infant nirsevimab administration, or both products combined.",
                    "detailedDescription": "RSV is the leading cause of LRTIs in infants and young children. It is also a leading cause of mortality in children \\<5 years of age worldwide. Until recently, no FDA-approved vaccines were available to prevent RSV infection in infants. Only the monoclonal antibody palivizumab was available to high-risk infants, but administration was limited to those with extreme prematurity, chronic lung disease, or hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. However, in 2023, the FDA approved two products designed to prevent RSV LRTD in all infants: an active RSV vaccine based on the prefusion F protein (RSVpreF, ABRYSVO, Pfizer) administered during pregnancy and a passive, long-acting monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab, BEYFORTUS, AstraZeneca) administered to infants at birth or at the start of the first RSV season. Both products were evaluated in Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials and were found to have high efficacy in the prevention of RSV LRTD in infants. However, the magnitude and durability of antibody responses following administration of the products have not been directly compared. This is important because although there are no well-established correlates of protection against RSV, serum antibodies have been associated with protection across multiple studies.\n\nFurthermore, the added benefit of administering both products to an infant has not been characterized. While cost-effectiveness analyses have demonstrated that administration of both products to the same mother-infant dyad is not cost-effective or indicated, it is likely that some infants may receive both products inadvertently, and still others may benefit from both. These include infants born to women who may not have mounted an adequate antibody response to vaccination (e.g., due to immunocompromise, prematurity, or insufficient time from vaccination to delivery) or who may have had impaired antibody transfer across the placenta (e.g., due to placental pathology). It also includes high-risk infants (e.g., with prematurity or chronic lung disease) who may benefit from an interval dose of nirsevimab for protection in the setting of waning antibodies and off-season RSV circulation. Thus, understanding the safety and serology of administration of both products vs. either product alone is of clinical and public health importance. These knowledge gaps underlie the objectives for this study."

The FACT-G was a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into 4 domains: Physical Well Being, Social/Family Well Being, Emotional Well Being, and Functional Well Being. The FACT-B consists of the FACT-G (27 items) and a breast specific module: a 10-item instrument designed to assess participant concerns relating to breast cancer. For all questions, participants were asked to respond to a 5-level scale ranging from 0=Not at all to 4=Very much. FACT-B total score = FACT-G + Breast Cancer Subscale. As each of the items ranges from 0-4, the range of possible scores is 0-148, with 0 being the worst possible score and 148 the best. A positive change of the total score indicated improvement from baseline and a negative change indicated deterioration.",

The FACT-G was a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into 4 domains: Physical Well Being, Social/Family Well Being, Emotional Well Being, and Functional Well Being. The FACT-B consists of the FACT-G (27 items) and a breast specific module: a 10-item instrument designed to assess participant concerns relating to breast cancer. For all questions, participants were asked to respond to a 5-level scale ranging from 0=Not at all to 4=Very much. FACT-B total score = FACT-G + Breast Cancer Subscale. As each of the items ranges from 0-4, the range of possible scores is 0-148, with 0 being the worst possible score and 148 the best. A positive change of the total score indicated improvement from baseline and a negative change indicated deterioration.",

                    "briefSummary": "Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength in older adults, is a key factor in health deterioration. It affects 15% of people between 65 and 80 years old and over 50% of those over 80, compromising autonomy and increasing the risk of diseases. Sarcopenia not only impacts muscle function but also bone health, mobility, and is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and cognitive decline.\n\nIt has been proposed that changes in the gut microbiota in aging individuals, known as gut dysbiosis, contribute to sarcopenia. Species diversity decreases, and bacterial representation is altered, which could impair muscle function through various pathways, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and disruption of protein synthesis. Muscle function loss is strongly associated with cognitive and metabolic impairment in older adults.\n\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective procedure for modulating gut microbiota and has proven highly effective in managing cases of Clostridium difficile-associated chronic diarrhea. The main objective of this project is to carry out FMT from young, physically active donors to a cohort of older adults to evaluate its effect on muscle, cognitive, and metabolic function.\n\nWhy donors who exercise? There is growing evidence that gut microbiota diversity is increased in young, physically active individuals. The FMT is planned to be administered through lyophilized microbiota capsules. By restoring microbial diversity, it is expected to improve the quality and function of skeletal muscles, leading to greater cognitive and metabolic resilience.\n\nThis project has great potential to develop an innovative approach for treating highly debilitating diseases that affect older adults, based on the lyophilization and encapsulation of gut microbiota from young, trained donors, which can be easily stored in a conventional freezer. Due to the high percentage of older adults worldwide and the high prevalence of sarcopenia within this age group, the aim of the project is to address a significant public health issue with a large target population eager for options to promote muscle health, functional autonomy, as well as cognitive and metabolic well-being.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Skeletal muscle loss in old age is a critical point for the development of very serious health conditions affecting the quality of life of older adults, such as loss of autonomy, loss of healthy cognition, and the development of complex metabolic diseases. Additionally, intestinal microbiota can be modulated through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and possibly this modulation could have direct effects that promote muscle health. Therefore, this project aims to investigate whether modifying the intestinal microbiota in older adults through FMT using young and trained donors can enhance skeletal muscle health and function, leading to greater resilience, reducing cognitive decline, and metabolic dysfunction associated with aging, especially in stressful contexts.\n\nThe donors would be young and trained individuals. Why trained donors? There is growing evidence that the composition of the intestinal microbiota is regulated by physical exercise. In animal studies, chronic exercise has been shown to increase the biodiversity of the intestinal microbiota and reduce systemic and intestinal inflammation. The bacterial profile associated with exercise is specific, for example, it does not correspond to that associated with a healthy diet, suggesting that physical activity allows for the development of a specific microbial profile in intestinal bacterial communities. Several studies have observed that changes in the intestinal microbiota associated with exercise are beneficial for promoting intestinal mucosal integrity and overall metabolic function in the individual.\n\nIn humans, intestinal bacterial biodiversity has been observed to be higher in athletes compared to sedentary subjects (normalized by body weight, age, and gender). In fact, there is evidence that a chronic exercise routine can restore the intestinal microbiota to a healthy profile in individuals with intestinal dysbiosis. In rats and mice, chronic exercise increases the biodiversity of Firmicutes, Bifidobacteria, and Actinobacteria and reduces the proportion of Bacteroides. Some data show how the presence of intestinal microbiota affects muscle performance, for example, it was found that germ-free mice had greater swimming endurance compared to germ-free mice, and when the latter were colonized with bacteria in the gut, the mice increased their physical endurance and swam for longer.\n\nThe main objective of this project is to carry out fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) from physically active young donors to a cohort of older individuals to evaluate their effect on muscle, cognitive, and metabolic function. FMT in older adults is planned to be performed by administering lyophilized microbiota capsules. By restoring microbial diversity, it is expected to improve the quality and function of skeletal muscles, leading to greater cognitive and metabolic resilience. It is important to mention that modifications of the intestinal microbiota have been associated with direct and specific effects on brain and metabolic functions, so the FMT from young and trained donors proposed in this project could have. This project has great potential to develop an innovative approach to treating highly debilitating diseases affecting older adults, based on the lyophilization and encapsulation of intestinal microbiota from young and trained donors, which can be easily preserved in a conventional freezer. This approach has been previously implemented for the treatment of C. difficile infection, with outstanding results. This idea will have a profound impact on the quality of life of adult and elderly patients, as it can be an alternative or complementary option to physical exercise therapy that older adults must undergo to prevent or treat sarcopenia, but often cannot be adequately achieved due to physical limitations associated with old age. Due to the high percentage of older adults worldwide and the high prevalence of sarcopenia among older adults, the researchers aim to address a significant public health issue with a large target population eager for options to promote muscle health, functional autonomy, as well as cognitive and metabolic well-being.\n\nRESEARCH QUESTION. The hypothesis is as follows: Intestinal microbiota transplantation from young, trained donors promotes resilience through the enhancement of muscle function, thereby preserving cognitive and metabolic performance in older individuals exposed to stressful situations.\n\nGENERAL AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES. General Objective To demonstrate that fecal microbiota transplantation from young and physically trained donors promotes muscle performance, preventing cognitive and metabolic decline in older individuals in a stressful context.\n\nSpecific Objectives To evaluate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from trained young donors on the muscular health of aged individuals, correlating the results with the degree of stress exposure of the elderly recipients of FMT.\n\nTo assess the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from trained young donors on cognitive parameters of elderly recipients, correlating the results with individuals stress levels and modifications of muscle function after FMT.\n\nTo evaluate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from trained young donors on metabolic parameters of elderly recipients, correlating the results with individiduals stress levels and modifications of muscle function after FMT.\n\nIn these objectives, researchers aim to investigate whether FMT from trained young donors can improve muscle function in older individuals, with beneficial consequences on cognitive and metabolic functions, correlating the results with the degree of stress exposure of the participants.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. The research is structured as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Researchers will work with a group of 92 elderly individuals (aged 65-84 years, both women and men). All the characteristics mentioned in the experimental design, in addition to the fact that through its implementation researchers aim to answer the question: Does the treatment (FMT in this case) generate a benefit (in this project, a muscular, cognitive, or metabolic benefit) in the context of a condition or disease (aging and stressful environment)? and also to evaluate the safety of the intervention, classify this research as a Phase II clinical study. Participants will be recruited at Cl\u00ednica Universidad de los Andes or the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA) of the Universidad de Chile, after signing an informed consent document. FMT will be administered using capsules of lyophilized fecal microbiota manufactured at the Center for Biomedical Research and Innovation (CIIB) of the Universidad de los Andes.\n\nFecal Microbiota Donors. The donors will be young individuals (aged 20 to 35 years, 2 males and 2 females), physically active, who engage in at least 150 minutes of high-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, as this type of training improves the diversity and production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of the human intestinal microbiota. The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and actigraphs will be used to measure physical activity in donors 2 weeks before stool donation. For donor selection, individuals will be considered to have reached a metabolic equivalent (MET) of 600 minutes or more per week.\n\nDonors will meet all criteria for donating fecal microbiota (criteria already established for FMT treatment in patients with CDAD.\n\nDuring the initial stage of the selection process, the medical history and risk behavior of potential donors will be assessed using a specialized questionnaire. The questionnaire will be administered by a medical professional. Objective evaluation includes the consequences of a specific response for the selection process. The topics and elements to be addressed in this questionnaire are listed in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1. Elements to Evaluate During Donor Selection Prior to Approval for Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT)\n\nInfectious Diseases\n\n* History of or exposure to infectious diseases with chronic activity: HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), unsuccessfully eradicated Helicobacter pylori, syphilis, malaria, trypanosomiasis, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, strongyloidiasis.\n* Any currently active or relevant infection within the last 6 months.\n* Live attenuated virus vaccination within the last 8 weeks. Country of birth. Risk Behaviors\n* Current or previous intravenous drug use.\n* High-risk sexual behavior within the last 6 months.\n* Travel to high-risk foreign countries within the last 6 months.\n* Current occupation in an environment facilitating the acquisition of potential pathogens (e.g., veterinarian, animal caretaker, ranger, prison worker).\n* Tattooing, piercing, or acupuncture within the last 6 months.\n* Major surgery within the last 6 months.\n* Contact with human blood (e.g., accident, needle stick injury) within the last 6 months.\n* History of incarceration.\n* Prior tissue/organ transplant.\n* Blood product transfusion (e.g., packed red blood cells, plasma, platelets, immunoglobulins) within the last 6 months of medical history.\n\nMedical History\n\n* Chronic diseases.\n* (Risk of) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n* Allergies or atopy (e.g., food or drug allergies, asthma).\n* Hospitalization within the last 4 months.\n* Ongoing pregnancy.\n* Antibiotic treatments, scheduled or received within the last 3 months.\n* Regular medications or nutritional supplements.\n* BMI (accepted if \u226520 and \u226425 kg/m2).\n* Age (accepted if \u226518 and \u226430 years).\n\nIntestinal Health\n\n* Previous or scheduled gastrointestinal surgery, except for appendectomy.\n* Gastrointestinal symptoms in the last 3 months (e.g., diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, vomiting, abdominal pain), or adenomatous polyps or sessile serrated lesions (removed).\n* Any other relevant clinical sign or symptom in the last 3 months (e.g., fever or rash).\n\nIn addition to all the infectious agents described in Table 2, SARS-CoV-2 will also be ruled out through RT-PCR in the stool. The presence of E. coli ST131 will be studied through classical culture and PCR typing, as well as the presence of antibiotic resistance genes. If positive results are obtained for these markers, the individual cannot be a donor. For each dose of FMT, a minimum of 150 grams of stool will be used, transported to the laboratory under the most anaerobic conditions possible (GutAlive system https://www.microviable.com/en/gutalive-2/) and in the shortest time possible from collection. Stool is a complex sample due to its variable water content, and the only way to standardize the dose is by the weight of the stool, as the amount of final powder can vary greatly. Therefore, the number of resulting capsules may vary widely. However, the microbial load will be equivalent as long as same logarithmic order is maintained. Stool will be lyophilized by mixing it with semi-skimmed lactose-free milk at a ratio of 1:2 as a cryoprotectant. The mixture will be homogenized in a Stomacher (230 rpm), solid residues will be removed by gentle centrifugation (500 rpm 5 min), and then all microorganisms will be collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm 15 min). The supernatant will be removed, and the pellet will be frozen at -80\u00b0C for at least 1 hour, after which it will be lyophilized at -50\u00b0C for 18-20 hours. The obtained powder will be encapsulated in enteric-coated capsules in batches that will be stored in the absence of moisture at 4\u00b0C with a shelf life of 6 months. An aliquot of all processes will be stored at -80\u00b0C, and sample and donor traceability will be carried out with RedCap software.\n\nElderly Participants Number of participants: 92 Ethnicity : Chilean population. Chile has a population with homogeneous ethnicity, with indigenous (40%) and European (60%) ancestries.\n\nAge: 65-84 years Biological sex: 46 males and 46 females\n\nStudy's recruitment, randomization, intervention, and follow-up process, organized in the following steps:\n\n* Recruitment: Participants are recruited and undergo an eligibility evaluation. They are assessed to determine if they meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria.\n* Informed Consent: Eligible participants who meet the study criteria provide their informed consent to participate.\n* Pre-intervention Evaluations: Before the intervention, participants are assessed to classify them based on their levels of stress and anxiety.\n* Randomization: A total of 92 participants are randomized into four groups:\n\nLow stress level - Placebo group (n=23) Low stress level - IMT group (n=23) Medium/high stress level - Placebo group (n=23) Medium/high stress level - IMT group (n=23)\n\nIntervention: Participants in the four groups undergo the assigned intervention:\n\nThe first group receives a placebo with low stress level classification. The second group receives IMT (Intervention of Interest) with low stress level classification.\n\nThe third group receives a placebo with medium/high stress level classification.\n\nThe fourth group receives IMT with medium/high stress level classification.\n\nFollow-up: Follow-up evaluations are conducted at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 20 post-intervention for all groups to assess the outcomes of the interventions.\n\nThis research is structured as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. This structure allows the study to compare the effects of the intervention (IMT) versus a placebo across different stress level classifications.\n\nPre-Intervention Assessments:\n\nThe 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) will be used to assess the level of stress in participants. Depressive symptoms will be evaluated using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), which assesses mood disorder symptoms commonly associated with depression experienced in older adults (both documents attached). Anxiety symptoms will be measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), which is designed to obtain a measure of anxiety that is relatively independent of depression (attached). These instruments have high reliability and validity in community samples, allowing us to classify the volunteers into low stress-anxiety and medium/high stress-anxiety groups.\n\nTo favor the establishment of the new ecosystem, the intestinal microbiota density of the participants will be reduced before the FMT with rifaximin (a suitable non-absorbable antibiotic for intestinal decontamination) for 3 days, 1,200 mg/day, administered in 2 daily doses. The antibiotic and its administration schedule will be provided to the participants.\n\nThe FMT will be conducted in the Clinical Trials Unit of the Universidad de los Andes Clinic by administering 4 capsules (containing a compact lyophilized preparation) prepared from approximately 150 grams of feces. Control subjects will receive placebo capsules with identical appearance to the capsules containing the intestinal microbiota lyophilized material. Free transportation will be provided to the participants between their homes and the Universidad de los Andes Clinic.\n\nResearchers will conduct this study using only non-invasive tests and analyses. All proposed assessments to measure muscle, cognitive, and metabolic functions will be carried out before and after the FMT (from 1 to 20 weeks after the FMT). These assessments will be conducted at the Ambulatory Care Health Center of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (CEDINTA). Free transportation will be provided to the participants between their homes and the CEDINTA. All participants will undergo medical history before and after the intervention to obtain information about overall health status, medication use, antibiotics, and dietary supplements, history of intestinal diseases, and any other intestinal disorder that may alter the intestinal microbiota.\n\nResearchers will calculate the Frailty Index (FI) in participants from all groups before and after the FMT. The FI will be assessed using a combined method of clinical and laboratory parameters. Firstly, researchers will use a self-reported FI created with 30 variables to assess health status. Variables comprise different types of health problems, including diseases (n=9), symptoms (n=6), disabilities for living (n=6), psychological problems (n=2), Romberg test, physical performance, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. For binary variables, the presence of an impairment will be coded as \"1\"; and its absence as \"0\". For each three-level variable, 0.5 will be used to represent an intermediate response level. For the MMSE, it will be coded as 0 if \\>23, 0.5 if MMSE=15-23, and 1 if MMSE\u226414, while GDS will be recoded as 0 if GDS\\<11) and 1 if GDS\u226511. Secondly, a laboratory-based FI (FI-lab) will identify 15 parameters based on 9 laboratory tests, in addition to pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, BMI, and waist circumference. A normal reference range will be used to compare each parameter, where \"0\" indicates values within the normal range and \"1\" indicates values outside the reference range. Finally, researchers will combine the two FIs to construct a 45-item FI (FI-combined). Each FI-combined will be defined as the score of each parameter of an individual divided by the total number of parameters considered, with the FI ranging from a theoretical minimum of 0 (no impaired parameters present) to a maximum possible of 1.0 (all impaired parameters present).\n\nFor the assessment of muscle sarcopenia, researchers will measure lean and fat mass using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and creatinine excretion. A standard dynamometer will be used to measure isometric strength. Additionally, the Short Physical Performance Battery and the 6-minute walk test will be applied to estimate maximum oxygen consumption. Physical activity will be evaluated using an actigraph for 7 days. Researchers will measure the thickness of the rectus femoris muscle and the muscle pennation angle in the participants' thighs using ultrasound. As biomarkers for sarcopenia, creatine kinase (CK), skeletal muscle troponin T (sTnT), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), C-reactive protein, vitamin D, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 will be measured in blood.\n\nFor cognitive performance, participants will be assessed on a set of higher cognitive abilities such as attention, executive functions, working memory, language, and processing speed, among others, before and after the FMT intervention. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test A and B, Digit Span Forward and Backward, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Verbal Fluency (FAS) will be administered (attachments). Participants' quality of life will be assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire, one of the most commonly used and evaluated instruments for Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL).\n\nFor metabolic function, a comprehensive analysis of metabolic markers in blood such as insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and transaminases (ALT, AST, gGT) will be performed in fasting conditions. Researchers will study the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using ultrasound imaging. Additionally, concentrations of metalloproteinases-9 and IL-6 in serum will be measured by ELISA, as these markers have been proposed to be correlated with the severity of NAFLD in humans. Non-invasive scores of hepatic fibrosis will also be applied.\n\nWith the bacterial genomic DNA isolated from the fecal samples of the participants, researchers will study the microbiota profile using shotgun metagenomics or 16S gene sequencing. Samples will be collected from both young donors and older recipients before and after the FMT. Using bioinformatics tools, researchers will identify a bacterial signature in older adults who received FMT from trained young donors. Researchers will determine if this microbiome signature correlates with muscular, cognitive, and metabolic resilience, especially in the group experiencing higher stress. Researchers propose that key elements in this modified intestinal microbiota in older adults will serve as appropriate biomarkers for muscular, cognitive, and metabolic resilience in the context of aging.\n\nSAFETY IMT performed by qualified personnel has not been associated with any serious adverse events, but mild or common adverse reactions may occur. Marcella et al. (2021) analyzed the presence of adverse reactions to IMT in a systematic review, evaluating 129 studies involving 4,241 patients. They found that the most common adverse effects were transient diarrhea (10%), transient abdominal cramps/discomfort (7%), nausea, and vomiting (\\<5%) within 24 hours post-IMT. Transient fever, abdominal distension, fatigue, and borborygmi have also been reported in less than 2% of cases. Constipation (2%) and excess flatulence (3%) were reported during follow-up.\n\nSevere adverse reactions, such as bacteremia and death as a direct consequence of IMT, are extremely rare (incidence \\<0.1%) and occurred only in patients with diseases causing damage to the digestive mucosa. These diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and ulcerative colitis) are exclusion criteria for this study. Another study in 2022 evaluated the safety associated with the use of IMT in 5,344 patients affected by CDI. The researchers found that, overall, the safety profile was favorable in a medically complex patient population that usually has poor clinical outcomes. Among the cohort, 194 patients (3.6%) experienced one or more serious adverse reactions (SARs). SARs were more common among patients with severe or severe-complicated CDI (n = 94 \\[48.5%\\]). Among the SARs, six events (0.1%) were possibly related to IMT, all in patients who were severely immunocompromised. This included two patients with fever, as well as one with abdominal pain in a patient with severe-complicated CDI and breast cancer. Additionally, two patients developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome-one after a heart transplant and one after a kidney transplant. There was one reported case of an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare-up in a patient with a history of ulcerative colitis not controlled with biological therapy and immunomodulators. None of the reported SARs were definitively related to IMT. Notably, no cases of sepsis or transmission of infectious diseases related to IMT, including infections with multi-drug-resistant organisms, were reported. This study will not include patients with CDI or those who are severely immunocompromised.\n\nFinally, another systematic review and meta-analysis in 2022 searched for IMT studies in patients with CDI, using the rate of SARs related to IMT as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included SARs unrelated to IMT and minor adverse events associated with IMT. The combined analysis of 5,099 patients who received 5,551 IMTs showed that SARs related to IMT developed in less than 1% of patients. The combined rate of SARs unrelated to IMT was higher, reaching 2.9%. The combined rate of minor adverse events also showed infrequent self-limited gastrointestinal and systemic discomfort. This meta-analysis supports IMT as a safe option for treating recurrent CDI.\n\nFor IMT performed exclusively in the elderly population, a study of 31 patients with an average age of 77 years with CDI reported that 87% of patients resolved their infection, and the most common adverse event reported in 4 (13%) of 31 respondents was the subjective worsening of arthritis. Another study that performed IMT on 35 elderly patients (average age 77 years) with CDI reported no serious adverse effects.\n\nIn summary, the international experience using IMT reported in the literature shows the high safety of this procedure. However, the following risks should be considered: (1) Infection: Although IMT has been screened for pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, there is a risk of transmitting known and unknown infectious organisms contained in the donor's stool. There is also a theoretical risk of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. Rarely, bacteremia (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella), sepsis, and fatal events can occur after IMT; (2) Exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in individuals with underlying IBD; (3) Allergy/anaphylaxis to antigens present in the donor's stool; (4) Transmission of non-infectious diseases: There is a theoretical risk of developing diseases that may be related to the donor's gut microbiota. These include obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune conditions, allergic/atopic disorders, neurological disorders, psychiatric conditions, and malignancies. This risk is very limited in the study, as individuals with these known conditions are excluded from stool donation according to the donor screening procedures explained in this protocol."

Samples will be collected from both young donors and older recipients before and after the FMT. Using bioinformatics tools, we will identify a bacterial signature in older adults who received FMT from trained young donors. We will determine if this microbiome signature correlates with muscular, cognitive, and metabolic resilience, especially in the group experiencing higher stress. We propose that key elements in this modified intestinal microbiota in older adults will serve as appropriate biomarkers for muscular, cognitive, and metabolic resilience in the context of aging.",

In patients with biopsy-confirmed amyloidosis, ambiguous amyloid typing results, and cardiac involvement alone, a negative pyrophosphate (PYP) or technetium-99m (99mTc) and 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD-Tc99m) bone scan is required to distinguish cardiac involvement due to AL amyloidosis from amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Data from the initial diagnosis are accepted.\n* Genetic testing must be negative for transthyretin mutations associated with hereditary amyloidosis, or immunohistochemistry/ immunofluorescence/ immunoelectron microscopy/ mass spectrometry of amyloid deposits must provide clear evidence of \u03ba or \u03bb light chains in patients who present with peripheral neuropathy or heart as the dominant organ involvement. Data from the initial diagnosis are accepted.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0,1 or 2\n* Mayo stage I-IIIA cardiac disease at Screening\n* Relapsed patients must have received at least 1 line of treatment, including Dara and bortezomib. Patients must have received at least two cycles of therapy. However, patients who have received high-dose therapy with melphalan as their only therapy are also eligible.\n* Measurable hematologic disease: a dFLC \\>20 mg/L with an abnormal \u03ba/\u03bb ratio (with Freelite\u00ae test kits, The Binding Site) or presence of a monoclonal spike \u22650.5 g/dL.\n* Adequate bone marrow function, without transfusion or growth factors within 5 days prior to the first drug intake (C1D1), defined as:\n* Absolute neutrophils \u22651,000/mm3,\n* Platelets \u226575,000/mm3,\n* Hemoglobin \u22658.5 g/dL.\n* Adequate organ function, defined as:\n* Serum creatinine clearance (CKD-EPI formula) \u226520 mL/min,\n* Serum SGPT/ALT \\<5.0 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN),\n* Serum total bilirubin \\<2.0 mg/dL or direct bilirubin \u226430% of the total, unless the patient has Gilbert's syndrome, where direct bilirubin should then be \\<2.0 mg/dL,\n* Serum albumin \u2265\\<2.5 gr/dl (medication to correct serum albumin levels is permitted).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Amyloid-specific syndrome, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or skin purpura, as the only evidence of disease. The finding of isolated vascular amyloid in a bone marrow biopsy specimen or in a plasmacytoma is not indicative of systemic amyloidosis.\n* Isolated soft-tissue involvement.\n* Presence of non-AL amyloidosis.\n* Previous anti-BCMA targeted therapy (including, but not limited to, bispecifics).\n* Intolerance to dexamethasone that would prohibit treatment with trial therapy.\n* MM diagnosed as per the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, with the exception of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) or smoldering Myeloma, not requiring treatment.\n\nNote: A MM diagnosis with a serum FLC ratio \\>100, as the only myeloma-defining event, does NOT constitute an exclusion.\n\n* All hematologic malignancies, with the exception of low-risk Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), not requiring treatment.\n* Mayo stage IIIB cardiac disease at Screening",

                    "detailedDescription": "This is a phase II pilot study designed to compare the pCR rate of two neoadjuvant immunotherapies in high-risk resectable melanoma with two integrated biomarkers. The integrated \\[18F\\]F-AraG imaging biomarker images activated CD8+ T cells. The CD8+ T cell density biomarker quantitates CD8+ T Cells using an automated method. The primary purpose of the study is to describe the correlation between pCR and the distribution of either biomarkers in patients receiving either neoadjuvant Vidutolimod (CMP-001)/nivolumab or neoadjuvant nivolumab.\n\nPatients with stage IIIB-IIID cutaneous (or unknown primary) melanoma with palpable nodal disease who have yet to undergo definitive surgery are eligible to enroll. Patients with nodal relapse including those who have received prior adjuvant IFN and/or ipilimumab are eligible to enroll.\n\nSuitable patients will be identified pre-operatively. Patients will undergo a 28 day screening evaluation including surgical assessment, clinical assessment, systemic/CNS staging scans, and laboratory studies to confirm suitability. Patients will undergo biopsies of both planned injected and uninjected lesions (Arm A) and target lesion (Arm B). Biopsies of these lesions will occur pre-treatment, at W3 or W4 and the target lesion(s) will be resected at the time of surgery.\n\nEligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive Arm A (neoadjuvant Nivolumab/(CMP) vs. Arm B (neoadjuvant Nivolumab) during the (Prime Phase) pre-operatively. Patients randomized to Arm A will receive: Nivolumab 240mg IV q2 x3 and CMP-001 5mg SC 1st dose then 10mg IT 2nd-7th doses (7 weeks). Patients randomized to Arm B will receive: Nivolumab 240mg IV q2 x3 (6 weeks).\n\n\\[18F\\]F-AraG PET-CT scan (18-F PET) is an integrated biomarker and will be performed at 2 imaging time-points: pre-treatment (pre-W1) and on-treatment (W2). At each imaging timepoint, \\[18F\\]F-AraG will be administered by a licensed nuclear medicine technologist under the supervision of a nuclear medicine physician on an outpatient basis. Each patient will receive a single bolus injection of 5 mCi \\[18F\\]F-AraG IV into a hand or arm vein. At Screening and W2 imaging timepoints, following \\[18F\\]F-AraG injection, a 30-min static PET-CT scan will be performed covering the brain to the upper legs.\n\nFor CD8+ T cell density assessments, patients will undergo biopsies at 2 timepoints: pre-treatment (Screening) and on-treatment (W3 or W4). In Arm A, patients will undergo biopsies of planned injected and a 2nd uninjected lesion. At each imaging timepoint, biopsies will be performed.\n\nFollowing the Prime Phase and restaging systemic scans, patients will undergo surgical resection.\n\nPost-operatively, patients will continue to receive maintenance therapy (Boost Phase) per randomization. In the Boost Phase, patients randomized to Arm A (neoadjuvant Nivolumab/(CMP) will receive 480mg IV q4 x12 along with Vidutolimod (CMP-001) 5mg SC q4 x12 over a 48 week period; while patients randomized to Arm B (neoadjuvant Nivolumab) will receive Nivolumab (480mg IV q4 x12 over a 48 week period). In the post-operative period, CMP-001 will be administered subcutaneously (Arm A only)."

Baseline testing will take place at the Center for Cognitive and Brain Health and Northeastern University Biomedical Imaging Center, for the baseline magnetic resonance imaging, in the interdisciplinary science and engineering complex on Northeastern University's campus. In person testing will take place over one session. The study period lasts 12 weeks, during which all participants will 1. Receive a weekly phone call with study staff and 2. Wear a wrist-worn Fit Bit tracker. A remote participation option is available for those who cannot travel to Northeastern University.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Older adults are more affected by cognitive impairments due to TBI as compared to younger adults. In addition, older adults are at a much higher risk for sedentary behavior. To address this, we intend to test the effect of two behavioral interventions on walking participation of older adults with a history of mild or moderate TBI. Participants will be randomized to either the planning, reminders, and micro-incentives group or to the health education tips group which are delivered over the phone and available virtually. We will give each participant a Fit Bit for the duration of the study, and we will use it to track their walking. Our primary aim is to see if there is a difference in the activity levels between the groups. Our secondary aim is to see if the MRI data we collect shows intra-brain connections correlate with physical activity.\n\nOur study is a 12-week two arm pilot randomized control trial-comparing two behavioral interventions. In one group, participants will have a weekly phone call with lab staff planning 5 days during each week that they plan on having a 30-minute walk. On the days of the walk, participants will receive either a text or an email, of their choice, reminding them of the planned walk. Participants will earn points for each planned walk completed; these can then be redeemed for a monetary reward at the end of the study. The other group will have a weekly phone call with lab staff where a health education tip is shared. Participants will also be provided a study FitBit where they will wear it during the times of the day when they are active.\n\nFollowing recruitment and informed consent, each participant will come into ISEC for their baseline assessment. During this assessment they will fill out questionnaires on their health history to include: Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, Ohio state university TBI Questionnaire, PROMIS global health and NeuroQoL Questionnaires, Mediterranean diet adherence, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, GAD-7, PHQ-9, BREQ-3 Physical Exercise Motivation, and the Physical Exercise Self Efficacy Questionnaire. Next, the participant will be asked to complete a battery of cognitive tests including: Digital and Paper Trail Making, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Letter and Category Fluency Test, and a mini mental status exam. This data will all be recorded via redcap. Next, the participant will undergo an MRI. This will take about an hour and the data will be uploaded to the Northeastern Cluster. Upon completion of the baseline session, each participant will be given a Fit Bit and assigned to the health education group or the planning, reminders, and micro-incentives group. Over the next 12 weeks, study staff will have access to the FitBit data collected and complete weekly calls with the participants, the content varying based on which group the participant is in. The final steps for the participants is their remote post testing where they will complete the same cognitive tasks and questionnaires as in their baseline assessment."

TBI severity will be defined as loss of consciousness of 0-30 minutes (mild) or \\&gt;30 minutes and \\&lt;24 hours (moderate). If no loss of consciousness was reported but post-traumatic amnesia was reported, then this is considered a mild TBI.\n\nIf clinical reports from the time of injury are available and Glasgow Coma Scale scores are available, then 13-15 is considered mild and 9-12 moderate. A clinical neurologist will review the de-identified OSU TBI forms for accuracy and confirm TBI severity.\n\n* Men and women of all ethnicities/races and socio-economic status.\n* 40-80 years.\n* Signed Informed consent.\n* Physically fit enough to undergo exercise as screened using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) and the cardiovascular section of the Health History \\&amp; Demographics Questionnaire. An affirmative response (i.e., \\&#34;yes\\&#34;) to any single item regarding an individual's health status is grounds for the necessary medical clearance before enrollment.\n* Normal or corrected-to-normal vision based on the minimal 20/20 standard in order to complete the cognitive tasks (below 20/20 vision).\n* Able to speak, read, and write English.\n* Ambulatory without pain or the assistance of walking devices.\n* Reliable means of transportation (if participating in Boston).\n* No diagnosis of a neurological disease.\n* No intracerebral brain bleeds.\n* Access to a mobile device, laptop or desktop computer with internet access and Bluetooth.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of a severe TBI (loss of consciousness \\&gt;24 hours, post-traumatic amnesia \\&gt; 7 days of a Glasgow Coma Scale of \\&lt;9) or the presentation of skull breach.\n* Prior diagnosis of cognitive or physical disability (severe asthma, epilepsy, chronic kidney disease, and dependence upon a wheelchair/walking aid).\n* Not fluent in English.\n* Undergoing any speech or physical therapy\n* Not medically cleared for exercise.\n* No history of vasovagal episodes (sudden drops in heart rate, poor perfusion, constant dizziness)\n* History of intracerebral brain bleeds or strokes.\n* Neurological condition (MS, Parkinson's, Dementia, MCI).\n* Current treatment for congestive heart failure, angina, uncontrolled arrhythmia, DVT or other cardiovascular events.\n* Myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, angioplasty or other cardiac condition in the past year.\n* Regular use of an assisted walking device.",

Our hypothesis is that there will be greater symptom resolution in the treatment versus control in the abnormal DI category. In addition, we hypothesize there will be less symptom resolution in the control group with an abnormal DI as compared to those with a normal DI who also receive no treatment.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Esophagogastric Outflow Obstruction (EGJOO) is a newer diagnosis in which some patients' symptoms resolve spontaneously or with conservative treatment, while others require treatment with botulinum toxin injected into the lower esophageal sphincter. Currently, there is no way to distinguish these two groups of patients upon diagnosis. EndoFLIP (endolumenal functional lumen imaging probe) is a new technology that can measure the distensibility index (DI) of the lower esophageal sphincter. Data has suggested that normal and abnormal DI measurements can categorize these patients and guide treatment course (1). Our study looks to confirm this finding.\n\n1. Elsbernd et al.
