                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to find out if adding HPV vaccination to adolescent health services works to increase HPV vaccine uptake in 10-13-year-old girls in Laos. The study will also look at the effects of adding HPV vaccination on the use of other health services in 10-13-year-old boys and girls.\n\nThe main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does adding HPV vaccination to adolescent health services increase HPV vaccine uptake in girls aged 10-13 years compared to girls who only receive standard HPV vaccination services?\n2. Does adding HPV vaccination to adolescent health services increase the use of other health services in 10-13-year-old adolescent boys and girls compared to adolescents who only receive standard HPV vaccination services?\n3. What are the barriers and facilitators to using the combined intervention in Laos?\n4. What are the opinions of adolescents, caregivers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders on the combined intervention?\n5. How much does it cost and how well it works to combine HPV vaccination with adolescent health services, as opposed to providing HPV vaccination alone?\n\nResearchers will compare a combined intervention to standard HPV vaccination services to see if the combined intervention works to increase HPV vaccination uptake and the use of other health services. The combined intervention includes HPV vaccination given at schools, health facilities, and through community outreach. It also includes education on sexual and reproductive health, counseling, and other health services. Participants in the combined intervention group will:\n\n1. Receive the HPV vaccine at school or at a health facility.\n2. Take part in group discussions about sexual and reproductive health.\n3. Take part in individual counseling sessions.\n4. Use other health services as needed.\n\nParticipants in the comparison group will receive standard HPV vaccination services, including:\n\n\u2022 HPV vaccination given at schools, health facilities, and through community outreach.",

To determine the extent to which the integration of HPV vaccination with adolescent health services increases HPV vaccine uptake among 10-13-year-old girls in the intervention district compared to the comparison district over 9 months.\n2. To assess the impact of the integrated intervention on adolescents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) among 10-13-year-old boys and girls, as well as their utilization of other adolescent health services.\n3. To identify barriers and facilitators to implementing the integrated intervention in the Laotian context, including its impact on healthcare providers' workload and capacity.\n4. To explore the perceptions of adolescents, caregivers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders regarding integrated intervention, including its perceived benefits and challenges.\n5. To determine the costs and effects of integrating HPV vaccination with adolescent health services compared to delivering HPV vaccination alone and assess the cost-effectiveness of the integrated intervention in the Laotian context. \\[A separate protocol will be developed for full methodology to determine the cost and effects.\\]\n\nResearch Questions:\n\nSO-1: 1.1) What is the difference-in-differences (DID) of change in the HPV vaccine uptake in the 10-13-year-old girls' population between the intervention and comparison districts over 9 months? 1.2) What factors contribute to the differences - if any - in HPV vaccine uptake as such between the intervention and comparison districts?;\n\nSO-2: 2.1) How does the integrated intervention affect 10-13-year-old adolescents' knowledge, and attitudes related to SRHR in the intervention district compared to the comparison district over 9 months?, 2.2) What changes in the utilization of adolescent health services among 10-13-year-olds are observed in the intervention district compared to the comparison district?;\n\nSO-3: 3.1) What are the main barriers and facilitators to implementing the integrated intervention in the Lao context?, 3.2 How does the integrated intervention impact healthcare providers' workload and capacity in the intervention district?;\n\nSO-4: 4.1) What are the perceptions of adolescents, caregivers, healthcare providers, educators and other key stakeholders regarding the benefits and challenges of the integrated intervention?, 4.2) How do the perceived benefits and challenges of the integrated intervention vary among different stakeholder groups?;\n\nSO-5: 5.1) What are the costs and effects of integrating HPV vaccination with adolescent health services compared to delivering HPV vaccination alone?, 5.2) How does the cost-effectiveness of the integrated intervention compare to that of delivering HPV vaccination alone in the Lao context?"

The treatment aims to stabilize the visual field deficiencies by lowering the intraocular pressure. Due to the fluctuation of the visual field test and re-test measures, the European recommendations are to obtain 6 visual field tests in 2 years (or one every 4 months) in order to know if the pathology is progressing despite the current treatment (or if the treatment is necessary, in cases of intraocular hypertensions). The lack of ophthalmologists renders the monitoring of a beginning glaucoma, rarely compatible with the present recommendations. It is therefore crucial to evaluate new therapeutic alternatives, when faced to a decreasing medical demography and an increase the patient's needs.\n\nThis study should allow to validate the possibility to delegate monitoring tasks to orthoptists during glaucoma surveillance. To organize the delegation of this surveillance to orthoptists would permit a better distribution of the ophthalmologist's activities."

                    "briefSummary": "The U.S. population is becoming more diverse, but minority groups are still significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials. This disparity limits our understanding of how treatments work across different populations. Efforts like the 21st Century Cures Act aim to improve inclusion, but challenges persist due to historical mistrust and complex barriers in healthcare.\n\nTo address these issues, Penn State Health is using a fun and educational approach called \"BINGO\" to engage the African American/Black community in Dauphin and surrounding counties. Led by the PSCI Diversity Navigator, these BINGO games will provide information about cancer and clinical trials in a relaxed setting. The goal is to build trust, increase awareness, and ultimately improve participation of underrepresented groups in clinical trials.\n\nThrough this initiative, they hope to connect participants with needed healthcare services and gather feedback to tailor future trials to community needs. This approach aims to foster collaboration between minority communities and the healthcare system, ensuring that clinical trials reflect the diversity of the population they aim to serve.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Penn State Health is addressing the underrepresentation of minority groups in cancer clinical trials through a community-engagement initiative using a BINGO educational game. Despite efforts like the 21st Century Cures Act, minority participation remains low, impacting the generalizability of trial results and access to novel treatments for diverse populations.\n\nLed by the PSCI Diversity Navigator, this initiative focuses on the African American/Black community in Dauphin and surrounding counties. The BINGO games serve as a platform to educate participants about cancer, clinical trials, and the importance of diversity in research. By creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere, the initiative aims to build trust and increase awareness among community members.\n\nThe project's long-term goals include fostering collaboration between minority communities and Penn State Health, improving clinical trial participation rates among underrepresented populations, and addressing healthcare disparities. Immediate objectives involve assessing the feasibility, educational utility, and engagement of the BINGO game through pre- and post-game surveys and knowledge tests.\n\nRecruitment efforts target community centers and organizations like historically Black sororities and churches, leveraging their influence and trust within the community. The initiative strategically focuses on areas with high African American populations, such as Harrisburg, to maximize impact and engagement.\n\nFeedback gathered from participants will guide future trial designs tailored to community needs, enhancing the inclusivity and relevance of research efforts. By promoting understanding and trust, Penn State Health aims to create a model that can be replicated to improve minority participation in clinical trials nationwide."

Compared to the control group (cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI), the triplet therapy cohort showed higher median overall survival (9.3 vs. 5.9 months) and response rates (26.8% vs. 1.8%). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 65.8% and 64.2% of patients for triple-therapy and control groups, respectively.\n\nBased on these results, the investigators speculated that the combination of encorafenib, cetuximab and binimetinib could be used as induction therapy to improve treatment outcomes in BRAF-V600E-mutated MSS aCRC locally advanced initially unresectable but potentially resectable; initially resectable or initially unresectable but potentially resectable oligometastatic disease; and in patients with stage II-IV who have relapsed after chemotherapy (neo and/or adjuvant) or surgery, if the shorter time after resection or from treatment end to relapse is longer than 6 months."

Descriptive Information Form, Child Fear Scale, Numerical Pain Scale and Child Satisfaction Scale will be used to collect the research data.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Pain and painful experiences make the child more vulnerable to pain. Since it is not possible to eliminate the feeling of pain in pediatric patients, effective pain management has an important place . This study aimed to determine the effects of cold application, vibration and vibrating ice on pain, fear and satisfaction levels in children aged 7-12 years who underwent blood glucose level measurement.The population of the study will consist of children aged 7-12 years who receive treatment and care in the pediatric ward of the Ministry of Health, University of Health Sciences, Izmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital between July 2024 and July 2025. Collection of Research Data The study will be started after ethics committee approval and written institutional authorisation.\n\nData will be collected before blood glucose measurement according to the clinical routine and the time of blood glucose measurement of the child. In the collection of data, pediatric patients admitted to the paediatric ward and their parents who meet the inclusion criteria of the study and agree to participate in the study will be informed about the purpose of the study and the study and their verbal and written permissions will be obtained.\n\n* Data collection forms (Descriptive Information Form, Fear Scale) will be applied to the children and parents in the sample group. Fear assessment of the child will be done by the child, nurse and parent.\n* The hand to be used for intervention will be determined by lottery. Cards labelled right and left will be prepared and the child will be asked to draw from the envelope in a closed manner.\n* After determining the hands for intervention and control, measurements will be made according to the clinical routine for the first control. In clinical routine practice, in the measurement of blood glucose level, a puncture is performed with a lancet pen, then the first blood is wiped off and the second blood is measured with a glucometer.\n* Intervention:\n* The index finger of the child will be used in the cold application group. In this group, cold application will be performed by placing the index finger of the designated hand on a 10 x 10 cm ice pack for 30 seconds and then removing the ice pack immediately.\n* In the vibration group, the middle finger of the child will be used. In this group, vibration was applied by targeting the tip of the middle finger area using a vibrator device measuring 2x1x3 cm. The insertion of the needle will coincide with the application of the vibration stimulation.\n* In the vibration and ice group, cold and vibration stimulation will be applied to the child simultaneously. The ring finger of the designated hand was placed on a 10x10 cm ice pack for 30 seconds and subjected to cold application. Simultaneously, vibration stimulation will be applied to the tip of the middle finger area using a vibrator device with dimensions of 3x1 cm and 2x1 cm. After 30 seconds, the ice bag will be removed and the lancet pen will be adjusted for drilling from the fingertip while vibration stimulation continues.\n\nAfter blood glucose measurement, Fear Scale, Numerical Pain Scale and Child Satisfaction Scale will be applied after each non-pharmacological intervention. Fear and pain assessment of children will be done by the child, nurse and parent."
