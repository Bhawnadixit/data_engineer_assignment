Our preliminary data has shown that DWI holds potential for detecting mammographically and clinically-occult breast cancers. However, current technical limitations reduce the sensitivity of DWI for screening applications.\n\nThe identification of a screening tool to complement mammography that is more accurate than ultrasound and faster, less expensive, and safer than conventional contrast-enhanced MRI would have significant clinical impact by improving the early detection of cancer in women with dense breasts. We hypothesize that an optimized DWI approach will enable detection of mammographically occult breast cancer in women with dense breasts with high sensitivity and low false positive rate.",

To understand why some people develop SUD, researchers need to develop reliable tests that show how people think and learn. This natural history study seeks to develop a set of tasks that could then be used to test how people learn and make decisions.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo develop and validate behavioral tasks that could be used in future studies.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy people aged 18-45 years from the Baltimore area. They must also be enrolled in the NIDA screening protocol.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will perform different tasks. Most tasks require 1-4 study visits; some may require up to 12. Visits are 1-14 days apart. All visits will last about 1-7 hours.\n\nParticipants will perform tasks on a computer. As they work they may be given different stimuli:\n\nSmells. Participants will sniff odors through a plastic tube or mask on their nose.\n\nFlavors. Participants will wear a mouthpiece and small amounts of different flavored liquids will be placed in their mouth.\n\nPictures. Participants will look at different images.\n\nSounds. Participants will wear headphones and various sounds will be played for them.\n\nFood. Participants may be asked to eat a meal before, during, or after a task. The researchers will provide the meal.\n\nDuring each task, participants will wear sensors to monitor their heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and other physical changes in their bodies.\n\nSome participants will have a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. They will lie on a table that slides into a cylinder. They will perform tasks on a computer screen during the fMRI.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nFrom a behavioral perspective, substance-use disorders (SUD) can be considered as disorders of incentive processing, learning, and decision-making. The Learning and Decision-Making Unit at NIDA IRP conducts Basic Experimental Studies involving Humans (BESH) to study the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying these functions, and their disruption in SUD. For this, behavioral tasks suitable for use both in and outside the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner need to be developed and validated.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe primary objective of this protocol is to develop and validate behavioral tasks inside and outside the fMRI scanner, and to determine their practical feasibility for future studies.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nThe primary endpoint is to determine if the developed tasks reliably and appropriately measure specific cognitive functions, and if they yield measurable and interpretable fMRI results in the associated brain systems."

Participants will be cleared for both the behavioral and MRI phases, if eligible, and will be invited to sign one or both consents depending on what tasks are active at the time of consent. If a person is not MRI compatible, they will only be offered enrollment into the behavioral phase of the study.\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet the following criteria:\n\n* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study.\n* Male or female, aged 18-45 years old. Justification: Many neural processes change with age, and these changes could introduce unwanted variability in both behavioral and MRI signals.\n* In good general health.\n* Agreement to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations throughout study duration\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in the MRI phase of this study, an individual must - in addition - also meet all of the following criteria:\n\n-Right-handed.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nIndividuals who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation:\n\n* History of neurological illnesses or neurosurgery including but not limited to cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, CNS tumor, significant head trauma with sequelae, multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, movement disorders. The MAI will also retain discretion to exclude based on a history of a neurological illness or trauma that may compromise data integrity.\n* History of current (past 12 months) major DSM-5 psychiatric disorder including major affective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, SUD (excluding Tobacco Use Disorder), and PTSD.\n* Daily smoking.\n* Current use of psychoactive medications and medications that affect alertness and that cannot (in principle) be withheld the night before the study visit. Participants who can withhold these medications will either (1) withhold the medication during this time or (2) not withhold the medication and pass a neuromotor exam on the day of the study visit. Based on participant preferences and MAI/PI judgement, participants who fail the neuromotor exam will either be withdrawn or rescheduled for a date and asked to withhold the medication.\n* For tasks that involve gustatory or olfactory stimuli, food intake: History of anaphylaxis, e.g., due to severe asthma or food and non-food allergies (e.g., latex, detergents, soap, etc.). This will disqualify participants for tasks that involve chemosensory stimuli or food intake, but not from the study itself.\n* Uncorrected impairments in visual acuity.\n* Non-English speaking. Justification: To include non-English speakers, we would have to translate the consent and other study documents and hire and train bilingual staff, which would require resources that we do not have and could not justify, given the small sample size for each experiment. Additionally, the data integrity of some of the cognitive tasks used in this study would be compromised as they have only been validated in English. Most importantly, ongoing communication regarding safety procedures is necessary when participants are undergoing MRI procedures. The inability to effectively communicate MRI safety procedures in a language other than English could compromise the safety of non-English speaking participants.\n* Pregnancy.\n* Any other condition that in the judgment of the investigators is incompatible with participation.\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the MRI phase of this study:\n\n-Unable to undergo MRI scanning due to certain metallic or magnetic devices or implants in the body, or claustrophobia.",

The promise of using Twitter is that its use is growing rapidly, it allows the investigators to view communications that were impossible to intercept before, and it potentially provides information faster and less expensively than collection from other media channels. Prior work also supports that social media interventions can improve health behavior change (e.g. weight loss, physical activity) and outcomes.The overarching goals of this proposal are to understand the uses and limitations of this communication channel to improve patients' ability to manage their CV health condition.",

The overall score is summed from individual items, reflecting the level of activation and self-management ability. The four levels are:\n\nLevel 1 (Score: 0-47.0): Lowest activation, indicating disengagement and lack of confidence in managing health.\n\nLevel 2 (Score: 47.1-55.1): Some awareness of self-management but limited skills and confidence.\n\nLevel 3 (Score: 55.2-67.0): Actively trying to manage health but inconsistent success.\n\nLevel 4 (Score: 67.1-100): Highest activation, indicating confidence and proactive health management.",

The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better outcomes-specifically, higher scores represent better outcomes. The overall score is summed from individual items, reflecting the level of activation and self-management ability. The four levels are:\n\nLevel 1 (Score: 0-47.0): Lowest activation, indicating disengagement and lack of confidence in managing health.\n\nLevel 2 (Score: 47.1-55.1): Some awareness of self-management but limited skills and confidence.\n\nLevel 3 (Score: 55.2-67.0): Actively trying to manage health but inconsistent success.\n\nLevel 4 (Score: 67.1-100): Highest activation, indicating confidence and proactive health management.",

The main aims of the study are to learn if TAK-019 can protect people from Covid-19 and to check for side effects from TAK-019 for participants who will receive TAK-019 as heterologous booster vaccination.\n\nThis study consists of two parts, main part and extension part. Firstly, participants who completed 2 doses primary vaccinations 6 to 12 months prior to the trial vaccination can take part in main study. At the first visit of main part of this study, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. Participants who can take part will receive an injection of TAK-019 as booster vaccination.\n\nParticipants will be asked to record their temperature and any medical problems in an electronic diary for up to 7 days after the injection. During the main part, participants will visit the clinic for regular check-ups, blood tests, and sometimes for nose swab samples. When all participants have attended a clinic visit 28 days after the injection, the study sponsor (Takeda) will check how many participants have made enough antibodies to protect them against Covid-19.\n\nParticipants who received the first single booster vaccination of TAK-019 in the main part and remained in study follow-up at least 5 months will be able to decide to take part in the extension part of this study. At the first visit of extension part of this study, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. Participants who can take part will receive an injection of TAK-019 as a second booster vaccination at the first visit of extension part.\n\nThe participants will stay in the main part of this study for up to 12 months after they have had their injection or up to the start of extension part. For participants who will take part in the extension part, they will stay in the extension part for up to 12 months from the start of extension part. During this time, the doctors will continue to collect blood samples to check immune response. Also, they will check if participants have any more side effects from TAK-019."

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Primary Objectives:\n\n* Determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ALRN-6924 in combination with paclitaxel in adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with wild-type (WT) TP53.\n* Evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALRN-6924 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced or metastatic WT TP53 solid tumors.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\n\u2022 Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of ALRN-6924 in combination with paclitaxel in solid tumors (in dose escalation) and hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (in expansion).\n\nExploratory objective:\n\n* Assess predictive and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of response.\n* Assess the effects of ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel on cell proliferation and apoptosis.\n* Assess the effects of ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) dynamics and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2/MDMX inhibitor ALRN-6924.\n\nPatients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and MDM2/MDMX inhibitor ALRN-6924 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months thereafter."

All patients (males and females) of childbearing potential must agree to use medically effective contraception during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of study drugs. A negative urine or serum pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential is required within 72 hours prior to first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n7. Have no concomitant medical condition (including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or any psychiatric disorder), that in the judgment of the investigator will interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the study or render such participation medically inappropriate.\n8. No medical history of another cancer (except basal or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer, or carcinomas in situ or other malignancies with a \u226595% 5-year survival) within 2 years of the start of study treatment.\n9. No investigational drug or other anticancer treatments (including chemotherapy or radiation, except palliative radiation) within 21 days or at least 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, of the start of the study treatment. No palliative radiation within 2 weeks prior to the start of the study treatment. Supportive treatments such as LHRH agonists can be continued for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer or pre-menopausal breast cancer while on treatment.\n10. No major surgery within 1 month of treatment and fully recovered.\n11. Willing and able to provide informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n1. Previous treatment with investigational agents that inhibit MDM2 or MDMX activity.\n2. Known active hepatitis B, hepatitis C and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who have a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count \\< 200. No antiretroviral medications that are CYP3A4 substrates will be allowed.\n3. Pre-existing history of or known cardiovascular risk:\n\n   1. History of acute coronary syndromes within 6 months prior to the first dose of ALRN-6924 (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, or stenting).\n   2. Uncontrolled hypertension\n   3. Pre-existing cardiac failure (New York Heart Association class III-IV)\n   4. Clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias\n   5. Corrected QTcF interval on screening ECG \u2265450 msec for males and \u2265470 msec for females (QTcF \\>480 msec for any patient with a bundle branch block).\n4. Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months prior to the start of study treatment.\n5. Females who are pregnant or nursing.\n6. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases by history, clinical signs or radiologic findings. Patients with previously treated brain metastases are eligible if clinically stable and off steroid treatment for 2 weeks prior to study enrollment. Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required.\n7. Known hypersensitivity to any study drug component.\n8. The required use of any concomitant medications that are predominantly cleared by hepatobiliary transporters, OATP members OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, on the day of the ALRN-6924 infusion or within 48 hours after an ALRN-6924 infusion.\n9. Patients with Grade \u22652 neuropathy will be excluded.\n10. Patients with a known Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-positive malignancy will be excluded from enrollment. This is owing to the fact that HPV-infected tumor cells continue to express the viral E6 protein, which is known to cause degradation of p53, hence rendering the expected ALRN-6924 - mediated dual inhibition of MDM2/MDMX very unlikely to restore p53 function.",
