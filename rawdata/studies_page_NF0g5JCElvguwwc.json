Furthermore, recently home self-assessment of the abortion outcome through a low sensitivity U-hCg test was shown to be highly acceptable to women. To evaluate whether counselling through telemedicine is non-inferior to face-to face counselling a RCT will be conducted including women who chose medical abortion up to 63 days of gestation with home administration of misoprostol and self assessment of the outcome. The results of this study could be of major importance to increase access to safe and acceptable abortion services."

Such a robust design will also lead to the identification an objective proxy to healthy diet adherence: the metabolomic signature. Secondly, by leveraging a cross-sectional cohort of adults with HeFH, the investigators will evaluate the relationship between the metabolomic signature of the healthy diet and cardiovascular disease risk factors in HeFH.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The research combines a dietary RCT (objectives 1, 2) and a cohort investigation (objective 3), both including adults with genetically-defined HeFH.\n\nThe dietary intervention will be undertaken as a crossover RCT at the Institute on nutrition and functional foods (INAF, Laval University) in Quebec City. Participants (men and women with genetically-defined HeFH) will consume in a random order a fully-controlled diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods, reflecting Canada's Food Guide principles (CFG diet in further sections), and a standard North American diet (NAD diet; i.e. control diet), reflecting current dietary intakes of French-Canadians, for 4 weeks each, and separated by a 4-week washout period.\n\nOnce enrolled, participants will enter a 2- to 4-week run-in period at the beginning of which they will stop taking their lipid-lowering medication for the study duration (16 weeks). Other medications (e.g. anti-hypertensive drugs, oral contraceptives) will be allowed, but doses will have to remain constant during the study. At the end of the run-in, participants will provide a blood sample and complete a self-administered, validated web-based food-frequency questionnaire. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the CFG-NAD or NAD-CFG diet sequence, using a computer-assisted program. The randomization (1:1) will be stratified by sex and LDL-receptor (LDLR) genotype in 5 blocks of 16 subjects. The two diets will be consumed for 4 weeks and separated by a 2- to 4-week washout period. During diet phases, all meals and foods will be provided to ensure optimal diet control using a 7-day cyclic menu. The CFG diet emphasizes low intakes of red and processed meats and high intakes of minimally processed plant foods with water as the drink of choice, as per Canada's Food Guide. The NAD diet reflects current dietary intakes of the French-Canadian adult population in terms of foods, nutrients, and diet quality, as characterized in recent surveys conducted in an age- and a sex-representative sample of adults from the Province of Quebec. An experienced food technician will prepare the diets. Each food and ingredient will be weighed with a precision of \u00b10.1 g.\n\nOn weekdays, subjects will visit INAF Clinical Research Unit to consume their lunch meal under the research coordinator's supervision. At that time, they will also be given their evening meals and the next day's packaged breakfast to take home. Weekend meals will be provided at the Friday visits. A checklist will be provided to all participants to identify the consumed foods.Alcohol, vitamin supplements, and natural health products will not be allowed. Tea and coffee (black) will be allowed (\u22642 servings/day without daily fluctuations). Participants will be instructed to maintain their usual physical activity level. At the end of each diet, fasting plasma samples will be collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. Parts of the samples will be stored at -80\u2103 for future ancillary analyses. Participants' anthropometry, body composition (DEXA scan), and blood pressure will be measured. To incorporate gender aspects associated with the intervention in knowledge transfer activities, subjects' appreciation of the diets and appetite sensation will be assessed using visual analog scales filled after each meal on day 7 and 28 of each diet.\n\nObjective 1: To investigate the impact of a diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods in place of a standard North American diet on LDL-C concentrations - the primary treatment target in HeFH management. This objective will output a convincing demonstration of the cholesterol-lowering effects of diet in adults with HeFH, supporting the effectiveness of dietary interventions in HeFH management. Investigators will compare post-diet LDL-C levels (primary outcome) using mixed models for repeated measures. Secondary outcomes include other atherogenic lipoproteins and lipids (apolipoprotein B, non-HDL-C, total-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a)) and other cardiovascular disease risk factors (fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, FH risk score, 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease). Potential effect modification by key participant characteristics (age, BMI, sex, LDLR genotype, lipoprotein (a) and diet sequence) will also be tested.\n\nObjective 2: To assess the impact of a diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods in place of a standard North American diet on the plasma metabolome. This objective serves a dual purpose as it will: 1. inform on the dietary impact on systemic metabolism, beyond its impact on LDL-C levels, further supporting the importance of healthy dietary habits in HeFH; and 2. allow the identification of an unbiased HeFH-specific plasma metabolomic signature of a diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods to be used as an objective proxy of diet adherence. To document post-diet differences in plasma metabolome and identify the metabolomic signature of the CFG diet, investigators will derive a reproducible multi-metabolite model discriminating the post-CFG/post-NAD metabolomic profiles.\n\nObjective 3: To evaluate the association between the plasma metabolomic signature of a diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods and cardiovascular disease risk. The metabolomic signature will allow to infer how objective adherence to a healthy diet is associated with cardiovascular disease risk in a distinct, large cohort of free-living adults with HeFH. This will provide an innovative demonstration of the role of diet in long-term cardiovascular disease prevention in adults with HeFH, further supporting the importance of a healthy diet in this high-risk population. To evaluate the association between the plasma metabolomic signature of the healthy CFG diet and cardiovascular disease risk in adults with HeFH, investigators will leverage a distinct cross-sectional cohort of adults with HeFH. Upon recruitment, participants underwent a complete clinical assessment and fasting blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes. Investigators will fit and standardize the CFG multi-metabolite model (signature) to the cohort metabolomic data. The relationship between the CFG multi-metabolite model (independent variable) and cardiovascular disease risk factos (plsama lipids, blood pressure) will be assessed using linear regressions.\n\nResults will fill key gaps on the short- and long-term influence of diet on cardiovascular health in HeFH."

                    "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter, international, phase II study of post-radiotherapy (RT) combination of ribociclib and everolimus to treat pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients newly diagnosed with HGG and DIPG that harbor alterations of the cell cycle and/or PI3K/mTOR pathways to assess treatment efficacy (Part 2). The study will include a feasibility cohort (Part 1) to identify the dose of ribociclib PfOS (Powder for Oral Suspension) that is safe and tolerable in combination with everolimus. Efficacy for Part 2 study will be defined by progression-free survival (PFS; HGG \\[stratum A\\]) and Overall Survival (OS; DIPG \\[stratum B\\]), with key longitudinal biomarker correlatives. Outcomes among patients with primary thalamic, spinal cord, and/or secondary (radiation related) HGG (strata C) will be descriptively analyzed. Objective radiographic response rates and agent-specific toxicities will also be assessed, with a feasibility cohort to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus in patients with metastatic disease who received upfront craniospinal irradiation (stratum D).\n\nProtocol therapy with the maintenance combination of ribociclib and everolimus must begin no later than 35 calendar days post-completion of RT. The earliest patients can begin protocol treatment is 28 calendar days post-completion of RT. Each cycle will be 28 days in duration and treatment can continue up to a total of 26 cycles. Ribociclib will be given orally once daily for 3 weeks (days 1-21), with one week off. Everolimus will be given orally daily continuously (days 1-28)."

Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must agree to use at least one highly effective method of contraception while being treated on this study and for 3 months after completing therapy. A woman is considered of childbearing potential if she is fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy. Male participants should refrain from sperm donation throughout the duration of treatment and for 3 months after completion of therapy\n\n   A highly effective contraception method is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (\\<1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.

Concomitant Medications\n\n   * Patients receiving corticosteroids are eligible. The use of corticosteroids must be reported.\n   * Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible.\n   * Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible, with the exception of temozolomide given concurrently with RT only.\n   * Patients who are receiving enzyme inducing anticonvulsants that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 are not eligible.\n   * Patients who are receiving strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 are not eligible and should be avoided from 14 days prior to enrollment to the end of the study.\n   * Patients who are receiving medications known to prolong QTc interval are not eligible.\n   * Patients who are receiving therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin or other coumadin-derived anticoagulants are not eligible. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux is allowed as long as the patient has adequate coagulation defined as aPTT \\< 1.5Xs ULN and INR \\< 1.5.\n3. Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.\n4. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.\n5. Patients with known clinically significant active malabsorption syndrome or other condition that could affect absorption are not eligible.\n6.

The primary goal of this study is to determine the frequency and timing of folate deficiency, and to learn more about whether giving folic acid supplements (vitamins) will help delay or avoid deficiency in these patients. Deficiency can cause doctors to reduce or stop treatment with olaparib. In this case, patients are not getting the best treatment for their cancer due to the unwanted side effect."

The weight of blanket a person uses overnight may alter both anxiety and pain levels. The proposed study will determine whether a heavier or lighter blanket alters presurgical anxiety or postsurgical pain in individuals undergoing a breast surgery. We will also study whether any blanket-induced changes in postsurgical pain are related to reductions in anxiety before surgery induced by the blanket. Finally, we will examine clinical and psychological factors that might explain differences in how surgical patients respond to blanket weight. This research will improve our understanding of whether blanket weight can alter anxiety before a surgery or pain after a surgery."

Newly diagnosed patients with AML deemed ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy (age 75 and older or \\< 75 years of age with comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction therapy) eligible to receive VEN at Screening. VEN may be combined with azacitidine or decitabine at the discretion of the treating Investigator.\n   2. Relapsed/refractory CLL eligible to receive single-agent VEN or VEN in combination with rituximab at Screening.\n   3. Newly-diagnosed CLL eligible to receive VEN in combination with obinatuzumab at Screening.\n2. Patients who have been receiving stable doses of VEN for at least 5 days prior to initiation of PIT add-on therapy.\n3. Age \u2265 18 years.\n4. Patients who are already on statins for dyslipidemias are eligible if their previous statin is stopped at least 72 hour prior to starting VEN-based therapy; administration of other statins is prohibited during the study.\n5. ECOG performance status \u2264 2 at baseline.\n6. Creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or higher; patients assigned to the highest dose level of PIT add-on therapy must have creatinine clearance 60 mL/min or higher.\n7. Liver Function tests within the following ranges:\n\n   1. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2264 3.0 \u00d7 ULN\n   2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 3.0 \u00d7 ULN\n   3. Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN (unless elevated bilirubin due to leukemic involvement in the liver or Gilbert's disease)\n8. Ability to understand and willingness to sign the informed consent.\n9. For the duration of the study treatment period and for at least 90 days following the last dose of study drug female of childbearing potential (FCBP) who are sexually active must agree to employ effective contraceptive methods. Effective contraceptive methods include use of hormonal contraception or an intrauterine device (IUD) by the female partner, or use of condoms by the male partner. An FCBP is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).\n10. For the duration of the study treatment period and for at least 90 days following the last dose of study drug, male patients must agree to use effective contraceptive methods during sexual contact with a female of childbearing potential (FCBP) and must agree to refrain from semen or sperm donation during the same timeframe.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who are receiving any investigational agents during the previous 30 days or at any time during the study.\n2. Patients who have previously received VEN.\n3. Patients who satisfy any of the contraindications for PIT.\n4. Patients with AML who received prior therapy other than hydroxyurea including those starting hypomethylating therapy for MDS after AML diagnosis.\n5. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia are excluded\n6. Patients with known CNS involvement with leukemia are excluded\n7. Patients with active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection are excluded. Patients with prior HBV or HCV exposure and those on antiviral medications with negative HBV or HCV viral loads are eligible, as long as the antiretroviral drugs being used do not have significant CYP3A4 interactions.\n8. Patients with uncontrolled HIV are excluded. Patients with known HIV and undetectable viral loads are eligible as long as the antiretroviral drugs being used do not have significant CYP3A4 interactions.\n9. Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to PEN, PIT, or other statins are excluded.\n10. Patients receiving are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 within 7 days prior to initiation of VEN therapy are excluded. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. An exception to this is made for patients with AML who require anti-fungal therapy with appropriate dose reduction in VEN (see Section 5.10.2.3).\n11. Patients who have consumed grapefruit, grapefruit juice or Seville oranges within 72 hours of initiation of VEN therapy. Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, or orange marmalade should be avoided for the duration of the study, as these affect CYP3A4 activity.\n12. Patients with certain uncontrolled intercurrent illness are excluded. These include, but are not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illnesses, or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n13. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded.\n14. Patients who are unable to swallow pills are excluded.\n15. Patients having a malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes the oral/enteral route of administration are excluded\n16. Patients with an active concurrent malignancy other than CLL or AML are excluded. Patients with a history of definitively treated prior malignancy with low risk of recurrence, skin cancers that have been excised, or on prolonged adjuvant hormonal therapy (ie, for breast or prostate cancer) but are otherwise considered in remission are eligible.",

                    "briefSummary": "American Indians are more likely to die from heart disease compared to other people in the United States. High levels of fat (lipids) and sugar (glucose) in the blood are related to heart disease. Young American Indians who are 18 to 39 years old have high lipid and glucose levels. This has led to heart disease later in life. This means they are likely to benefit from a program to lower these levels.\n\nIn this project, researchers will work with American Indians in rural southwestern Oklahoma. The researchers will start by asking American Indians how they would like to design a program for younger members of their community. After getting permission, the researchers will take a small amount of blood from young community members. The researchers will measure lipid and glucose levels and ask those with high levels to be in the study. Then the researchers will do several measurements. These will include blood pressure, height, weight, diet, physical activity, sleep, tobacco and alcohol use, access to health care, and social support. The researchers will compare these measurements to similar measurements taken from young American Indians 20 years ago, collected through the Strong Heart Study, which is the longest running study measuring heart disease in American Indians.\n\nNext, the researchers want to know if the program they developed with the American Indian communities will work. To do this, they will put people in one of two groups. They will decide which group each person will be in using a process that is like flipping a coin (heads for one group, tails for the other group). One group will receive educational booklets about how to avoid getting heart disease. The other group will receive help from a community health worker. The community health worker will help participants to get to the doctor for treatment. They will also help participants change their diet and exercise routines and provide education about heart disease risk factors. After 9 and 18 months, the researchers will repeat the measurements to see if one of the groups has lower lipid or glucose levels.\n\nThis program will support the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's mission to \"reduce human disease\" by lowering lipid and glucose levels, which are related to getting heart disease. This will be done by using the community health worker model to help people go to the doctor and improve their lifestyle related to diet and exercise. The researchers will also be able to advance heart health in American Indians in rural Oklahoma by lowering factors related to heart disease.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in American Indians is more than two-fold higher than the age-matched United States (US) population, and significantly associated with elevated lipids/lipoproteins and glucose levels. Through systematic surveillance conducted by the Strong Heart Study (SHS), the largest and longest running study of CVD in American Indians, we report that elevated lipid/lipoprotein prevalence for participants \\<20, 20-29, and 30-39 years old was 55.2%, 73.6%, and 78.0%, respectively. In addition, we report that American Indians under 40 years old with elevated LDL cholesterol had a three-fold greater independent risk of subclinical atherosclerosis five (5) years later and/or incident, clinical CVD 20 years later. Although statin therapy is effective for dyslipidemia, the rates of use are low among American Indians, with less than 50% of young SHS participants with primary hypercholesterolemia receiving treatment. In addition, the high diabetes prevalence (8%) in young American Indians contributes to high rates of CVD, where incidence of atherosclerosis was 41.3 per 1,000 person-years in diabetics compared to 16.3 per 1,000 person-years in non-diabetics (p\\<0.001). These elevated lipid/lipoprotein and glucose levels may be due to limited health care access and lifestyle factors such as nutrition, physical activity, sleep hygiene, and social determinants of health (SDOH), including social support. As a result, there is a critical need to measure these factors and include them in a culturally appropriate intervention to control lipid/lipoprotein and glucose levels and thereby reduce CVD.\n\nThe long-term goal of this research, which aligns with the NHLBI's strategic goal to \"reduce human disease,\" is to reduce incident CVD risk in American Indians. Our overall objective is to determine the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate intervention, designed with American Indian involvement, to control lipid/lipoprotein and glucose levels. To achieve this objective, we will determine the effectiveness of a guided intervention. Before determining the intervention effectiveness, we will use a community-engaged approach and conduct focus groups asking participants to offer recommendations for a modified version of the Balance Study that we conducted with older (mean age=52 years) American Indians in Oklahoma, 2008-2012. Subsequently, we will recruit 360 American Indians, 18-39 years old, with elevated lipid/lipoprotein or glucose levels. Among this group, we will assess baseline CVD risk factors and then randomly assign them to either a self-managed control group receiving health care referrals and educational materials or to an 18-month guided intervention group, incorporating: 1) community health workers (CHW) to reduce health care access barriers and 2) a multidimensional component focusing on nutrition, physical activity, and CVD risk factor education during at least six (6) quarterly in-person meetings. Based on the Balance Study and SHS, we formulated the central hypothesis that health care access, nutrition, physical activity, and CVD risk factor education jointly contribute to lipid/lipoprotein and glucose control. Therefore, the rationale for the proposed research is to include these components in an intervention targeting lipid/lipoprotein and glucose management. Given our experience with American Indian communities recruiting and designing interventions for the SHS, we are well-positioned to conduct this research, with the following Specific Aims:\n\nAim 1: (A) To work with CHWs, healthcare workers, community leaders, and community members to adapt a culturally relevant CVD risk factor intervention based on the Balance Study for American Indians, 18-39 years old. (B) To assess the acceptability of the adapted intervention among American Indians, 18-39 years old from communities participating in the Strong Heart Study in southwestern Oklahoma. We will work with members of the community to adapt a lifestyle intervention for younger populations that was previously used in older populations of American Indians, titled the Balance Study. Then we will conduct focus groups among American Indians who are 18-29 or 30-39 to determine the acceptability of adapted intervention among these groups.\n\nAim 2: To determine if the adapted 18-month guided intervention is more effective than self-management at lowering LDL-C or glucose levels, among American Indians, with serum LDL-C \u2265100 mg/dL and/or fasting plasma glucose \u2265126 mg/dL who are 18-39 years old from communities participating in the Strong Heart Study in southwestern Oklahoma. Hypothesis: American Indians, 18-39 years old, randomized to the guided intervention, will have at least a 10% reduction in LDL-C and/or glucose levels after 18 months.\n\nThe proposed research will determine the effectiveness of an intervention that uses the CHW model to target health care access, nutrition, physical activity, and CVD risk factor education within the young adult American Indian population. The expected outcomes include the refinement of a culturally appropriate CVD risk factor reduction intervention and the reduction of LDL-C and glucose levels in young American Indians with elevated CVD risk. This study will decrease the disproportionately high lipid/lipoprotein and glucose levels that are significantly predictive of incident CVD in young American Indians."
