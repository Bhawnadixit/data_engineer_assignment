                    "briefSummary": "Babies who are born prematurely often develop a chronic lung disease called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD puts babies at higher risk for problems with growth and development. Diuretics, such as furosemide, are frequently used in the management of early BPD). Many clinicians use informal trials of therapy to see if a baby responds to diuretics in the short-term before starting chronic diuretic therapy. Despite frequent use of diuretics, it is unclear how many babies truly respond to therapy and if there are long-term benefits of diuretic treatment. Designing research studies to figure this out has been challenging. The Pragmatic Research on Diuretic Management in Early BPD (PRIMED) study is a feasibility pilot study to help us get information to design a larger trial of diuretic management for BPD. Key questions this study will answer include: (1) Can we use an N-of-1 trial to determine whether a particular baby responds to furosemide? In an N-of-1 trial, a baby is switched between furosemide and placebo to compare that particular infant's response on and off diuretics. It is a more rigorous approach to the informal trials of therapy that are often conducted in clinical care. We hope to learn how many babies have a short-term response to furosemide (\"responders\"); (2) how many babies will still be on respiratory support at the end of the N-of-1 trial? This will help us determine how many patients would be eligible to randomize to chronic diuretic therapy in the second phase of the larger trail, and (3) if a baby is identified as a short-term responder, how many parents and physicians would be willing to randomize the baby to chronic diuretics (3 months) versus placebo in the longer trial?"

Histological diagnosis makes it possible to differentiate healthy areas from pathological areas. Functional diagnosis allows the identification of brain areas to be spared during neurosurgery in order to avoid any permanent post-operative disability.\n\nThe visual analysis of the color and texture of the brain by the trained eye of the neurosurgeon is largely part of his operating practice. It allows it to differentiate between healthy and pathological areas. Likewise, color variations linked to the functional activation of brain areas are sometimes visible to the naked eye. However, this approach is not optimal due to the limits of human vision. It is also very strongly dependent on the experience and expertise acquired by the neurosurgeon. This approach is therefore largely limited in many operating contexts: low visual contrasts, less experienced neurosurgeon."

                    "detailedDescription": "Study location: Cairo university hospitals\n\nMethodology:\n\nPatients with basic type intermittent exotropia who are indicated to undergo surgical intervention will be grouped into two groups one group will undergo bilateral lateral rectus recession and the other will undergo bilateral medial rectus resection.\n\n* Preoperatively, all patients will be subjected to:\n\n  1. A detailed history taking including presence of asthenopia, monocular closure, disfigurement or diplopia. The previous use of glasses for optical correction, use of minus lenses, or prior part time occlusion will be documented.\n  2. A detailed ophthalmological examination; including uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity whenever possible, cycloplegic refraction, anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination.\n  3. Motor Evaluation:\n\n     * Ductions and versions will be done to assess the ocular motility in 9 positions of gaze.\n     * The angle of deviation will be measured by the alternate prism cover test for both distance (6 meters) and near (33 cm) , with and without glasses.\n     * The angles of misalignment will also be measured in side gazes and in straight up and down gaze whenever possible.\n     * In patients with near-far disparity, the angle of deviation will be measured again after patching one eye for 30 minutes, as well as after putting +3 D lenses in front of each eye.\n\n     Patients with near-far disparity \\>10 prism diopters (PD) will not be included\n  4. Sensory Evaluation:\n\n     Worth 4 dot test and stereopsis using Random dot test (when possible) The control of exotropia will be assessed using both the newcastle control score\n\n     Patients will be randomly assigned to either surgery using simple randomization by random number generator\n* Intervention:\n\n  * One group will undergo bilateral lateral rectus recession and the other will undergo bilateral medial rectus resection according to the standard tables.\n  * All cases will be done under general anaesthesia.\n  * Both surgeries take about 30 minutes.\n  * Postoperative treatment combined tobramycin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops 3 times daily and the same combination eye ointment at night for 3 weeks.\n  * Postoperative follow up will be 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months (minimum follow up)\n* Postoperative assessment:\n\n  * Extraocular movement in lateral gazes will be examined for comitance\n  * Alignment in the primary position will be assessed and any deviation will be measured using alternate prism cover test\n  * Palpebral fissure height will be measured\n  * Worth 4 dot test and stereopsis will be assessed (when possible)\n\n    * In cases of failure either over correction or under correction reoperation will be performed after 3 months of the initial surgery.\n* Sample size\n\nWe are planning a study of the difference in the postoperative angle between the 2 surgical techniques. Assuming a mean difference of 5 PD with a standard deviation of 5 PD, an alpha error of 0.05 and a power of study of 0.8, a total of 17 subjects were found to be needed in each group. Assuming a drop-out rate of 20%, a sample of 20 subjects will be targeted in each group."

In this multicenter trial, sixty-two patients will be enrolled in forteen Chinese sites. Participants will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive three WMTs through either mid-gut tube or colonic TET. After WMT, each participant will receive free diet plus home enteral nutrition. Home enteral nutrition should last for 2 months at home, with blood, urine and stool samples taken and stored at baseline and 2 months after WMT.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Background: Malnutrition is a common complication of nonphysiological reconstruction of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The potential of washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) in improving nutritional status have been reported. The surgery procedure alters the anatomy and physiology of the digestive tract, which might impact the efficacy and safety of WMT when choosing different delivery way. This study aims to explore the optimal delivery of WMT in malnourished patients after rerouting of the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n\nMethods and design: This multicenter, open-label, and randomized controlled trial will be conducted at forteen hospitals in China. Enteral nutrition (EN) will be administrated at enrollment. Participants will be then randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive three WMTs through either mid-gut tube or colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET). Then the patients will receive free diet coupled with home enteral nutrition (HEN) for 8 weeks in both groups, with blood, urine and stool samples taken and stored at baseline and 2 months after WMT. The observation duration is 8 weeks. The primary endpoint is nutritional status of the patients. The nutritional status data obtained at baseline and 8 weeks after discharge includes body mass index (BMI) and skeletal muscle index (SMI). The secondary endpoints are nutritional assessment, nutrition-based laboratory indices, 60-day readmission rate, quality of life, gastrointestinal symptom scale, the safety of WMT and further analysis of the biological specimens.\n\nConclusion: It is estimated that WMT would help improve nutrition status. Moreover, this trial has the potential to identify the optimal delivery of WMT for patients undergoing nonphysiological reconstruction of the upper gastrointestinal tract."

The MG-ADL targeted symptoms and disability across ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and axial symptoms. The total MG-ADL score was obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (8 items; Grades: 0, 1, 2, 3), where 0 represents no symptoms or impaired performance and 3 represents the most severe symptoms or impaired performance. The total score ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating more disability. A positive change in the score indicates worsening and a negative change indicates improvement.",

                    "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nIn a previous study, participants were lived at the NIH and randomly received either a low-fat or a low-carbohydrate diet for 2 weeks and then switched to the other diet for 2 more weeks. Participants who received the low-carbohydrate diet first lost more body fat at the end of the study than those who received the low-fat diet first. Researchers want to see if they can repeat that result in a longer weight loss study when participants live at home.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test the effects of diet order in people receiving either a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet first for 4 weeks and then immediately switched to the other diet for another 4 weeks.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 19 to 50 years with a body mass index of 25 or more.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will complete the study at their homes, but there will be 3 required visits to the NIH. Participants will drink a special type of water 2 weeks before the baseline NIH visit and collect urine samples at home to measure how many calories they burn. Before the diets begin, participants will visit the NIH for baseline testing when they will have a metabolism test while relaxing in a bed with a plastic hood over their head to collect the air they breathe out. They will have scans to measure their bone density and how much muscle and body fat they have. They will give stool, blood, and urine samples.\n\nParticipants will be asked to eat a specific diet for 4 weeks followed by a different diet for 4 weeks. All meals will be delivered to the participants homes. They will eat only the foods delivered.\n\nParticipants will weigh themselves daily. They will wear a monitor to track their physical activity and a sensor to measure their glucose levels. They will prick their finger each morning to test a drop of blood for ketones. Participants will meet virtually as a group with the study team weekly. Participants will have two more NIH visits towards the end of each diet period....",
