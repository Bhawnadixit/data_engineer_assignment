                    "briefSummary": "Purpose/Objectives: To investigate the effect of hyperglucagonemia on insulin action, particularly on adipose tissue.\n\nResearch Design/Plan: Normal glucose tolerant subjects will be studied. Study subjects will receive a continuous glucagon infusion for 12 hours. Following glucagon infusion, subjects will receive prime-continuous tracer infusions for additional 4 hours to measure adipocyte metabolism. Within 6-8 weeks, subjects will return for a repeat study with normal saline as a control group.\n\nMethods: All subjects will have an oral glucose tolerance test prior to participation to confirm they are normal glucose tolerant. Subjects will be admitted to the CRC at 4 PM and will receive a continuous glucagon for 12 hours. At 6 AM on the following morning, subjects will receive prime-continuous tracer infusions of the following for 4 hours (14C-glycerol, 3-3H glucose, and D2O). At 10 AM continuous indirect calorimetry will be performed to determine rates of energy expenditure and glucose/lipid oxidation for 40 minutes. At 6 AM a surgical biopsy of abdominal adipose tissue will be performed for measurement of adipocyte metabolism. At 8 AM, the study team will infuse insulin/glucose to test for insulin sensitivity.\n\nClinical Relevance: The results of this study will help the study team to further understand the pathophysiology of metabolic disturbances that is induced by hyperglucagonemia in type 2 diabetes patients.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Visit 1 Screening: All subjects will be performed indirect calorimetry to determine rates of energy expenditure and glucose/lipid oxidation for 40 minutes prior to all other procedures to obtain a fasting calorimetry. Subjects then will have a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test to document the presence of normal glucose tolerance. Blood will be drawn at -30, -15, 0 and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes thereafter for the determination of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, FFA, glycerol, GLP-1 and GIP concentrations. The total amount of blood to be taken during the OGTT is 148 ml or about 10 tablespoons. Participants will also undergo a total body fat (DXA) and hepatic fat content (MRS). Subjects will also have a routine physical exam, an ECG, weight, height, vitals and collection of prior medical history. The study team will also check blood glucose (sugar) and blood lipid (fat) levels. The total amount of blood that we will take for the screening blood tests, HbA1c, lipid, and other blood tests is 34 ml or about 2 1/3 tablespoons.\n\nVisit 2 Adipose Tissue Metabolism Measurement: Subjects (n=12) will be admitted to the CRC at 4 PM on the day prior to study and received a standardized, weight maintaining diet containing 50% CHO: 30% fat: 20% protein. At 6 PM subjects will receive a continuous glucagon (3 ng/kg.min, N=6) or glucagon (6 ng/kg.min, N=6) for 12 hours. Subjects will remain fasting after 10 PM. Samples for glucagon, FFA, insulin and C-peptide will be collected at 1700, 1730, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2300, 0100, 0300, and 0500 hours.\n\nAt 6 AM on the following morning subjects will receive prime-continuous tracer infusions of the following for 4 hours (see figure 1):\n\n(i) 14-C-glycerol (prime = 30 \u00b5Ci; continuous infusion = 0.3 \u00b5Ci/min) for determination of total body rate of lipolysis.\n\n(ii) 3-3H-glucose (prime = 40 \u00b5Ci; continuous infusion = 0.4 \u00b5Ci/min) for determination of rates of total body glucose appearance and disappearance.\n\n(iii) D2O (5 g/kg fat free mass at 9 PM orally) to determine the rate of de novo lipogenesis.\n\nAt 6 AM a surgical biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue will be performed for measurement of hormone sensitive (HSL) lipase activity, AMPK activity, and serine phosphorylation of HSL (see Figure 2), FGF-21, FAP, Beta-klotho. Insulin signaling (IR/IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, PI-3 kinase activity, Akt) molecules, GLUT4, markers of inflammation (IkB, NF-kB, T4R4TLR4, JNK, p38 MAPK, M2/M1 macrophages, IL-1, IL-6, TNF alpha, MCP-1) also will be measured on the fat biopsy. Lipidomic analysis to quantitate the amount of and type of fat in the adipose tissue biopsy also will be performed. After surgical biopsy of adipose tissue, starting the tracer equilibration (6AM) blood will be drawn every 15-30 minutes for 4 hours (6-10 AM) for substrate (glucose, FFA, glycerol, triglycerides), hormone (glucagon, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, GIP, adiponectin, leptin, FGF21 \\[active and total\\], FAP \\[degrading enzyme\\]), radioisotope (14-C-glycerol and 3-3H glucose) specific activity. Participants will place their hand in a transparent plastic thermo-regulated box heated to 50-60\u00b0C (122-140\u00b0F) to ensure good blood flow to the hand. Pasma samples for radioisotope activity (background) will be obtained at 6 AM. At 9 AM continuous indirect calorimetry will be performed to determine rates of energy expenditure and glucose/lipid oxidation for 40 minutes.\n\nThe glucagon infusion will be continued through the 4-hour tracer infusion (i.e. 6AM-10AM). At the end of the glucagon infusion (\\~10 AM) a repeat measurement of hepatic fat content will be obtained. A total of 366 ml of blood will be drawn.\n\nAt 8 AM the insulin sensitivity test will be done during the last two hours of the tracer infusion. During the 2 hours of the insulin sensitivity test, the insulin (60 mU/m2 \u22c5 min) and glucose will be given through the catheter in the vein in the subject's arm to determine rates of whole-body insulin sensitivity. There are no expect adverse reactions to be experienced by the subjects during both infusions."

The app, designed with cognitive-behavioral techniques, offers weekly tasks to improve mental health over a three-month period. The study follows a case-control design, with initial and follow-up evaluations using the PHQ-9 and GHQ-12 questionnaires to assess mental health status. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in emotional distress and depression symptoms among the participants.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Detailed Description:\n\nThis study, titled \"APP: Mental Health Intervention Model for Healthcare Workers,\" seeks to evaluate a novel mobile app-based intervention aimed at addressing mental health challenges among healthcare professionals at Hospital Le\u00f3n Becerra in Milagro, Ecuador. The intervention leverages Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques to mitigate emotional distress and reduce symptoms of depression. This approach offers a scalable, flexible, and low-cost solution to support mental well-being in healthcare environments, particularly in response to the increased psychological strain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStudy Rationale and Theoretical Framework:\n\nHealthcare workers are often exposed to stressors that lead to cumulative mental health burdens, including extended working hours, emotional labor, and the pressure of making life-or-death decisions in real time. The added impact of the pandemic has exacerbated these stressors, leading to a rise in reported cases of burnout, anxiety, and depression. In resource-limited settings, where access to mental health services is often restricted due to logistical, financial, or cultural barriers, mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer a promising solution.\n\nThe intervention model of this study is grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a well-established psychotherapeutic approach with a strong evidence base for treating depression and anxiety. CBT works by helping individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns, develop emotional regulation techniques, and engage in behaviors that improve mood and well-being. In digital form, CBT maintains its efficacy and can be delivered asynchronously, making it ideal for busy healthcare workers who need flexibility in how and when they access mental health support.\n\nIntervention Model and App Features:\n\nThe mobile app used in this study has been specifically designed to incorporate core components of CBT, including cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and emotional regulation strategies. It delivers 12 weekly tasks that participants are expected to complete over a three-month period. The app has been developed with healthcare professionals in mind, considering the high-demand nature of their work and their need for accessible, short, and impactful mental health tools.\n\nEach weekly task focuses on a different aspect of CBT and is structured to promote cognitive reframing, emotional awareness, and behavior change. Examples of tasks include:\n\nWeek 1-3: Introducing participants to the basics of CBT and guiding them in identifying negative thought patterns that contribute to emotional distress.\n\nWeek 4-6: Implementing emotional regulation strategies, teaching participants how to manage stress, anxiety, and sadness through mindfulness and relaxation techniques.\n\nWeek 7-9: Engaging in behavioral activation, encouraging participants to take actionable steps to improve their mood, such as goal setting and increasing engagement in pleasurable activities.\n\nWeek 10-12: Reinforcing coping strategies and relapse prevention techniques to help participants maintain their mental well-being after completing the program.\n\nThe app features include:\n\nInteractive Tasks: Participants complete guided exercises within the app that allow them to apply CBT techniques to their own experiences.\n\nReminders and Prompts: Automated notifications remind participants to complete their weekly tasks, improving adherence to the intervention.\n\nProgress Tracking: Participants can track their progress over time, reviewing completed tasks and assessing improvements in their emotional state.\n\nResource Library: The app provides access to educational materials on stress management, self-care, and coping mechanisms that healthcare workers can access at their convenience.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nThe case-control study design allows for a robust evaluation of the app's effectiveness. Participants are randomized into either the intervention group, which will use the app, or the control group, which will not receive the app intervention during the study period. This design allows for clear comparison between groups, controlling for natural fluctuations in mental health that might occur over time without the intervention.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of the app in reducing symptoms of depression (as measured by the PHQ-9) and emotional distress (as measured by the GHQ-12). The secondary objectives include evaluating user engagement with the app, user satisfaction, and the feasibility of scaling the intervention to other healthcare settings.\n\nImplementation and Technology Integration:\n\nThe mobile app will be implemented in a user-friendly manner, compatible with both Android and iOS devices. Participants will be provided with a secure download link, and the app will include a brief tutorial to help users familiarize themselves with its features. Data collected through the app (including questionnaire responses and engagement metrics) will be encrypted and securely transmitted to a central server for analysis, ensuring participant confidentiality and compliance with data privacy regulations.\n\nTo facilitate high engagement, the app has been designed with busy healthcare professionals in mind, offering flexibility in when and where they complete their weekly tasks. The app's design also includes built-in mechanisms to identify users who may need more intensive mental health support. For example, if a participant reports severely elevated depression scores during any task, the app will trigger an alert, prompting the research team to reach out and offer additional support or referrals to mental health services.\n\nData Collection and Analysis Plan:\n\nThe primary data for this study will be collected through the PHQ-9 and GHQ-12 questionnaires, administered at baseline (T0) and three months post-intervention (T1). These tools are internationally recognized and validated for assessing depression and emotional distress, respectively. In addition to self-reported mental health outcomes, user engagement data (such as task completion rates and time spent on the app) will be automatically tracked by the app.\n\nData will be analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics:\n\nDescriptive statistics will summarize baseline characteristics of the participants, including age, gender, professional role, and prior mental health diagnoses.\n\nIndependent t-tests will be used to compare the mean change in PHQ-9 and GHQ-12 scores between the intervention and control groups.\n\nMultivariate logistic regression models will be employed to adjust for potential confounders, such as age, profession, education level, and prior mental health status. These models will help isolate the effect of the intervention from other factors that may influence mental health outcomes.\n\nUser engagement metrics will be analyzed to determine adherence to the intervention and its correlation with changes in mental health outcomes. This will involve examining the relationship between app usage (e.g., number of completed tasks) and reductions in PHQ-9 and GHQ-12 scores.\n\nEthical Considerations and Feasibility:\n\nThe study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the ethics committee at Hospital Le\u00f3n Becerra, and informed consent will be obtained from all participants before their enrollment. Participants will be fully informed about the study's objectives, their right to withdraw at any point, and the confidentiality measures in place. Mental health support will be available to participants who exhibit elevated levels of distress during the study, ensuring their well-being is prioritized.\n\nThis study represents a critical step in assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of mHealth interventions in healthcare settings. The findings will not only contribute to the understanding of digital mental health tools but also provide practical insights into how these tools can be integrated into the daily lives of healthcare professionals, helping to mitigate the mental health crisis facing this population."

Develop an annotated biospecimen panel of extramedullary leukemia biopsies prior to and after radiotherapy to examine local immune responses using transcriptional profiling, immunofluorescence and single cell analyses.\n\nIII. Define changes in the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes, functionality and inflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and serum.\n\nIV. Correlate changes in anti-tumor immune responses with clinic-pathological variables and patient outcomes.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the overall response rate (ORR= complete response \\[CR\\] + partial response \\[PR\\]) of the extramedullary tumor treated with radiation therapy.\n\nII. To assess the CR of extramedullary tumor treated with radiation therapy. III. Determine the duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo biopsy prior to radiation therapy and 7-14 days after radiation therapy. Patients also undergo blood sample collection prior to therapy (within 7 days of starting radiation therapy), 1 and 7 days post completion of radiation therapy. Patients' photographs of the biopsy site are taken before and at 4-6 weeks post completion of radiation, and their medical records are reviewed for up to 2 years."

Based on the anatomical layers of the cornea at different depths, it consists of four layers: a superficial anterior layer of 120 \u03bcm, a posterior layer located within the innermost part of the cornea measuring 60 \u03bcm; central layers calculated by subtracting thickness of the anterior and posterior layers from the total layer thickness; and a total layer.

The remainder occur via direct admission, defined as admission to hospital without first receiving care in the hospital's ED. The overall goals of this research are to: (i) implement pediatric direct admission systems at 3 hospitals, (ii) compare the timeliness of healthcare delivery for children who are admitted directly and through emergency departments, (iii) determine which patient populations achieve the greatest benefits from direct admission, and (iv) identify barriers and facilitators of successful implementation.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The Specific Aims of this research are to: (i) Determine the effect of a pediatric direct admission system on timeliness of healthcare provision (the investigator's primary outcome), family experience of care, and rates of clinical deterioration compared to hospital admission beginning in the ED; (ii) Identify the pediatric populations and conditions that experience the greatest benefits from direct admission; and (iii) Through interviews with key informants, identify barriers to and facilitators of implementing standardized direct admission processes.\n\nTo achieve these Aims, a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial at three geographically diverse hospitals in the United States will be conducted, randomizing primary and urgent care practices in the hospitals' catchment area to cross over to the direct admission intervention at four time points. Linear models with random effects for clusters and time period fixed effects will be used to evaluate outcomes associated with the direct admission intervention. To examine for heterogeneity of treatment effects, interactions between direct admission and a priori-specified subgroups will be examined."
