This is a multicenter, open-label, superiority, individually randomized controlled trial including patients undergoing anterior rectal resection with primary anastomosis and a protective stoma. Patients scheduled for anterior rectal resection are randomized 1:1 to loop ileostomy or loop colostomy intraoperatively. Primary outcome is cumulative stoma-related adverse events within 60 days post-primary surgery (scored using Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI))."

We will randomize patients to continue their aspirin or change clopidogrel which is also approved for secondary prevention.\n\nUnlike aspirin, clopidogrel may have activity against S. aureus. We wish to determine if changing to clopidogrel will improve outcomes in S. aureus bacteremia in people who otherwise would have a reason to be taking it.\n\nThis study is an approved sub-study of The Staphylococcus aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) trial (NCT05137119).\n\nIf positive, this study will support a second RCT in people who do not currently have an indication for clopidogrel."

Ideally, at least one of the following should be present to confirm the diagnosis of stroke: confirmation by neurology, stroke specialist, or neurosurgical specialist, brain imaging (e.g., CT scan, MRI scan, or cerebral vessel angiography compatible with acute ischemia). If the acute focal signs represent a worsening of a previous deficit, these signs must persist for more than 24 hours and be accompanied by an appropriate new MRI or CT scan finding. In the absence of neuroimaging, a staff neurologist consult which makes the diagnosis of stroke will be considered.",

This study will also explore whether there are differences between patients who received neurofeedback (NFB, a type of therapy that is thought to help normalize brain activity) and those who did not. Learning about quality of life in cancer patients with neuropathy during the COVID-19 pandemic may help guide development of programs and policies to improve chronic pain patient care and outcomes during a major global healthcare crisis.",

Assess experiences during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (e.g. physical, emotional, social well-being), and other COVID-19-specific domains (e.g. anxiety, social interactions, finances), and the associations between COVID-19 experiences and COVID-19-specific distress, HRQOL and clinical outcomes of patients who participated in one of three clinical trials.\n\nII. Examine differences in outcomes between neuropathic pain patients who participated in one of two trials of NFB and received NFB, and neuropathic pain patients who participated in a non-treatment-related neuropathy study (i.e., who did not receive NFB).\n\nIII. Evaluate the extent to which coping and resilience factors moderate the effects of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific distress, HRQOL and clinical outcomes.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients complete an online questionnaire over 15 minutes about their experiences regarding the COVID-19 pandemic including testing, risks of exposure, whether people they know have acquired COVID-19, as well as questions on how the pandemic has impacted their quality of life."

                    "detailedDescription": "While opioids have been commonly used in the operating room due to their effectiveness in pain management and anesthesia, there are numerous common side effects that have an impact on patient recovery. Obese patients or those with pre-existing respiratory difficulties such as sleep apnea or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are more likely to experience respiratory failure after getting opiate therapy. Other effects of opioid use include gastro-intestinal obstacles such nausea, vomiting, and constipation.\n\nThe concept of opioid-free anesthesia evolved due to the potential adverse side effects associated with intraoperative opioid usage.\n\nThis study examines nociceptive monitoring's potential role in opioid-free anesthesia, as well as research on the topic. This study aims to compare the effects of an opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) regimen versus an opioid-based anesthesia (OBA) regimen on postoperative pain and enhanced recovery in patients undergoing bariatric surgery."

                    "detailedDescription": "Approximately 290 patients are planned to be screened to ensure at least 216 patients complete the run-in period and start with the assessment period.\n\nPatients with Grade 1-2 hypertensive patients (blood pressure \\[BP\\] ranging from \u2265140/90 mmHg to \u2264179/109 mmHg) on treatment with any angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) including Zofenopril (ZOF)30 mg or with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) including Amlodipine (AML)5 mg will be screened for eligibility (Visit 1).\n\nAllowed CCBs: Felodipine, isradipine, lacidipine, lercanidipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, and nisoldipine. Patients treated with other dosages of ZOF (other than 30 mg) are not allowed to be screened. After screening, on the same day, eligible patients, will enter into a 4-week run-in period, during which patients on other ACE-i will be assigned to monotherapy with ZOF 30 mg while patients on CCBs will be assigned to monotherapy with AML 5 mg for 4 weeks. Patients with on-going treatment zofenopril 30 mg and amlodipine 5mg will continue on the same treatment for 4 weeks.\n\nAfter the run-in period (4 weeks \u00b1 2 days), BP will be further assessed (Visit 2), if BP levels are over the defined controlled target goal, sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)/Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) \\>130/80 mmHg, treatment is well tolerated and adherence to the treatments ranges from 80% to 120%, patients will enter the assessment period, where they will be assigned to the extemporaneous combination of ZOF 30 mg and AML 5 mg. At Visit 2 patients with SBP/DBP values classified as Grade 3 (SBP \u2265 180 or DBP \u2265 110 mmHg) hypertension will be withdrawn from the study.\n\nIf patients, at Visit 2, after the run-in period, have a controlled BP (sitting SBP/DBP\u2264130/80 mmHg) or do not tolerate the treatment or have an adherence range below 80% or superior to 120%, they will be withdrawn from the study.\n\nThe patients will be assessed for further 8 weeks (assessment period). After 4 weeks \u00b1 2 days from Visit 2,during the assessment period patients receiving the extemporaneous combination of ZOF 30 mg and AML 5 mg, will be further evaluated (Visit 3): controlled patients (sitting SBP/DBP \u2264130/80 mmHg) will continue the same extemporaneous combination for additional 4 weeks \u00b1 2 days, while uncontrolled patients (sitting SBP/DBP \\>130/80 mmHg) will be up-titrated from ZOF/AML 30/5 mg to ZOF/AML 30/10 mg for further 4 weeks \u00b1 2 days. At Visit 3 patients with SBP/DBP values classified as Grade 3 (SBP \u2265 180 or DBP \u2265 110 mmHg) hypertension will be withdrawn from the study. If patients at Visit 3, do not tolerate the extemporaneous combination treatment or they have an adherence range below 80% or superior to 120%, they will be withdrawn from the study.\n\nAt the end of the assessment period (8 weeks \u00b1 4 days) at Visit 4, the anti-hypertensive effect of the extemporaneous combination (ZOF/AML 30/5 mg and ZOF/AML 30/10 mg) will be evaluated.\n\nEfforts will be made to achieve 1:1 ratio in the enrolment of patients receiving any ACE-i or allowed CCBs (refer to section Subject Study Phases Duration for allowed CCBs). At Visit 2, a minimum of 45% of uncontrolled patients receiving treatment with ZOF 30 mg or AML 5 mg are required to enter the assessment period, in order to maintain a balance between the 2 treatments during the assessment period."

The exposure is prescriptions of methylprednisolone or prednisolone tablets and the primary outcome is heart failure hospitalizations within the following 6 months, i.e. acute contacts with secondary or tertiary health care resulting in a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Secondary outcomes include broader heart failure diagnoses and the initiation of loop diuretics. Data preparation includes an initial observation period of 2 years, inclusion criteria such as age, corticosteroid formulation types / dosages and prescription codes, as well as removal of duplicate prescriptions and measures to reduce potential carry-over effects."

Analyses will be restricted to tablets, as prednisolone is only available in this form.\n3. To allow for equipotent dose comparisons, we will focus only on 4 mg and 16 mg methylprednisolone and their counterparts in prednisolone at 5 mg and 20 mg, respectively. Patients with other doses will be excluded.\n4. To facilitate comparisons of treatments prescribed for similar conditions, we will only include prescriptions with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD10) or International Classification of Primary Care, 2nd Edition (ICPC2) refund code.\n5. Patients with prescriptions for diagnosis codes including palliative care, cancer symptoms, medical complications, and organ transplants will be excluded. This exclusion aims to reduce the inherent heterogeneity within these groups, allowing for a more comparable baseline risk.\n6. An initial 2-year observational period, spanning from January 2008 to December 2009, will be used to establish comorbidities. Accordingly, only prescriptions of methylprednisolone or prednisolone dispensed from January 2010, onward, will be eligible for analyses.\n7. To minimize the risk of carry-over effects, we will exclude all prescriptions prescribed \\< 6 months after another prescription for a corticosteroid. Accordingly, the same patient can contribute data on several treatment courses, provided that there was \\> 6 months since the last prescription was dispensed (See section 7 for justification for why a 6-month interval was chosen).\n8. Duplicate prescriptions (same date, drug and dosage) will be kept in the analyses as a single treatment course. Cases of duplicate prescriptions on the same date, but where the drug or dosage is different will be excluded.\n9. Baseline of the treatment course will be defined as the date when the prescription of either methylprednisolone or prednisolone was dispensed.",
