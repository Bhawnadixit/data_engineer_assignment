                    "briefSummary": "Genetic diagnosis for neonates suffering from epilepsy has important implications for treatment, prognosis, and development of precision medicine strategies. Investigator performed exome sequencing (ES) or targeted sequencing on neonates with seizure onset within the first month of life. Investigator subgrouped our patients based on the onset age of seizure into neonatal and before 1 year (1-12 months), to compare the clinical and genetic features and treatment strategies.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Seizure is one of the most common neurological conditions in neonates, and has substantial impact on patients'quality of life and social integration. Epileptic encephalopathy is characterized by refractory seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and poor prognosis. Despite the recent progress in technology, molecular diagnosis of neonates suffering from possible epileptic seizures can be challenging, due to genetic and phenotypic heterogeneities. A large number of specific pathogenic variations have been related to various forms of epilepsies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has significantly improved the molecular diagnosis for rare diseases. NGS focusing on genes known to be associated with human diseases is a practical approach as a first-tier assessment for patients with heterogeneous genetic background. In addition, currently medical therapy for seizure is not based on the etiology, but the clinical manifestations, and the main purpose is not to rescue the underlying diseases process, but just to reduce the likelihood of seizures occurrence. In this study, Investigator performed NGS on neonates with seizure onset before 1 year of age, to detect and quantify genetic variants, and assess existing therapeutic effects. Our findings will have important implications for the development of precision medicine strategies."

                    "briefSummary": "This trial is linked to a largescale observational study determining the efficacy of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir in people in Pakistan (involving a separate protocol). The observational study will identify a cohort of patients who have not responded to first-line antiviral therapy (sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir) and the optimal treatment for these patients is unclear. This trial will address this issue by comparing two second-line treatment regimens to determine the preferred treatment option.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes liver damage and, in many, liver cancer. We have effective drugs allowing us to cure most infected people and this stops the liver becoming damaged. Hepatitis C is common in Pakistan and the government is planning a massive national program to find and treat everyone who is infected. The government funded treatment program will fund therapy and assumes that the drugs will cure the vast majority of infected people and hence, in line with international recommendations, they are not planning to evaluate treatment outcomes. The efficacy of the drugs used in Pakistan (sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir) have not been widely assessed in the Pakistani population and their efficacy is not yet proven. In a separate protocol the efficacy of first line therapy in Pakistan will be determined and this study will examine the optimal management for people who have not responded.\n\nThis trial will determine optimal treatment regimens in resource poor settings by comparing two affordable, readily available treatment options. 268 patients who meet the inclusion criteria and who accept participation will be enrolled. These patients will be randomly allocated to two equal sized groups (134 per group) and allocated 1:1 (stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis) to receive: i) 12 weeks treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or ii) 24 weeks treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. An additional 50 patients with decompensated cirrhosis will form a third observational group iii) who will receive 24 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Patients will be assessed for sustained virological response (SVR) from the point of randomisation at 12 (+/-1 week) and 24 weeks (+/-1 week) and then finally at 36 weeks (+/-2 weeks).\n\nThe study outline is as follows:\n\n1) HCV patients who fail to respond to the first-line therapy regime will be identified via sustained virological response (SVR) assessment 12 weeks (range 11-18 weeks) after completion of a course of all oral antiviral therapy with sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for either 12 or 24 weeks with or without ribavirin provided by a recognized provider of health care in Pakistan.\n\n* Potential participants who have been invited to participate will have a member of the medical team explain the details of the trial, they will then be given a maximum of 24h to read the relevant information sheets and to speak to a clinical member of the study team to ask any further questions, before they commence the process of fully informed consent.\n* After obtaining written informed consent, a study specific participant identification number (ID) will be assigned to the participant.\n* Consenting patients will have venepuncture performed as per the site's standard operating procedure (SOP). The donated pre-treatment plasma sample will be retained\n* Once enrolled, the 268 patients accepted into the study will be randomly allocated into two groups (134 patients per group) using a computerised 1:1 randomisation programme (stratified by the presence or absence of decompensated cirrhosis) to receive:\n\n  i) sofosbuvir(400mg/day)/velpatasvir (100mg/day) - 12 weeks ii) sofosbuvir(400mg/day)/velpatasvir (100mg/day) - 24 weeks\n* The third observational group of decompensated patients (up to 50 patients) will be given sofosbuvir (400mg/day)/velpatasvir (100mg/day) - 24 weeks\n* All patients will be treated for either 12 or 24 weeks.\n* Each patient will be reviewed at weeks: 4 (+/- 1 week), 12 (+/-1 week), 24 (+/-1 week) and 36 ((+/- 2 week) after the first dose of second-line treatment (randomisation).\n* Patients with second-line treatment failure will have 10ml blood sample taken for viral sequencing.\n* Data will be collected on paper case report forms (CRFs) which will be securely stored prior to the data being transferred to a secure on-line database. Paper records will be retained as primary source documents.\n* Cost effectiveness of the treatment regimens will be measured from the Pakistan health service perspective. Costings for the drugs, clinic, laboratory testing, staff and facility costs associated with each treatment regimen per patient will be calculated."

The current recommendations are that patients without cirrhosis should receive sofosbuvir 400 mg per day in combination with daclatasvir 60 mg per day for a total of 12 weeks and for patients with cirrhosis therapy should involve sofosbuvir 400 mg per day in combination with daclatasvir 60 mg per day for a total of 24 weeks. Patients who receive additional medication (including ribavirin) can be enrolled in the study but the additional medication should be noted.\n* The subject's medical records must include sufficient detail of prior treatment to confirm eligibility.\n* Have a stored sample of serum or plasma that is known to contain detectable HCV RNA and which can be made available to the study team or be willing to provide such a sample\n* Have undergone, or be willing to undergo, an approved screening test for determining liver cirrhosis either by:\n\n  1. APRI score - calculated from serum AST concentration in IU/L and platelet count /L (a result of \u22652 demonstrates presence of cirrhosis)\n  2. Liver transient elastography assessment (a 'Fibroscan'). A result of \u226512.5 kPa will demonstrate cirrhosis.\n  3. liver biopsy within 1 year of screening\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 prior to enrolment.\n* Lactating females must agree to discontinue nursing before starting study drug.\n* Subjects must be able to comply with the dosing instructions for study drug administration and able to complete the study schedule of assessments.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unwilling or unable to give consent\n* Clinically significant illness (other than HCV) or other major medical condition that may interfere with the subject's treatment, assessment or compliance with protocol.\n* History of discontinuation the most recent regime due to an adverse event\n* Co-morbidities limiting life expectancy to less than 12 months\n* Gastrointestinal disorder that could interfere with the absorption of the study drugs\n* Significant cardiac disease\n* Unstable psychiatric condition\n* Significant drug allergy (e.g. hepatotoxicity)\n* Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Unable or unwilling to undergo the necessary procedures - undergoing blood testing and ultrasound/fibroscan scanning.\n* Previous poor compliance with medication (defined as failure to take \\>80% of the prescribed medication)\n* Have undergone liver or other solid organ transplantation\n* Have a current or recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma or any other malignancy",

                    "briefSummary": "This phase I/Ib trial tests the safety, side effects, best dose, and effectiveness of ASTX660 (tolinapant) in combination with eribulin mesylate (eribulin) in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or that has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or to other places in the body (metastatic). Tolinapant may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking proteins, such as XIAP and cIAP1, needed for tumor cell survival. Chemotherapy drugs, such as eribulin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving tolinapant in combination with eribulin may be safe, tolerable, and/or effective in treating patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic triple negative breast cancer.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the safety and tolerability of ASTX660 (tolinapant) in combination with eribulin in patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n\nII. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASTX660 (tolinapant) in combination with eribulin.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of ASTX660 (tolinapant) and eribulin when used in combination.\n\nIII. Determine the pharmacodynamic parameters of antitumor activity of ASTX660 (tolinapant) and eribulin combination.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Develop biomarkers predictive of response and resistance to ASTX660 (tolinapant) in combination with eribulin in metastatic triple negative breast cancer.\n\nII. Investigate biomarkers and mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to ASTX660 (tolinapant) in combination with eribulin in metastatic triple negative breast cancer.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tolinapant in combination with eribulin followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients receive tolinapant orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 and 15-21 and eribulin intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

Previous corticosteroid therapy must be stopped or reduced to the allowed dose at least 7 days prior to the CT/MRI screening. If a patient is on chronic corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed dose before the screening. Patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Short-term (up to 7 days) systemic corticosteroids above 15 mg prednisolone or equivalent will be allowed for the management of acute conditions (e.g., treatment non-infectious pneumonitis)\n* Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. Patients with compression or pathologic fractures that are stable in the opinion of the investigator may be enrolled, as long as the bone fracture is not felt to pose a high likelihood of treatment delay or difficulties in treatment adherence as per the judgement of the investigator\n* Patients with active, clinically serious infections \\> grade 2 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] version \\[v\\]5.0) (viral, bacterial or fungal infection)\n* History of known pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) infection or documented non-infectious pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD)\n* Patients with arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 3 months before the start of study medication\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as blood pressure \u2265 150/90 mm/Hg) despite optimal medical management (per investigator's opinion)\n* Proteinuria as estimated by urine protein/creatinine ratio \\> 3.5 g/g on random urine sample or grade \u2265 3 as assessed by 24-hour urine protein collection\n* Patients with history of, or current uncontrolled autoimmune disease. Patients who have adrenal or pituitary insufficiency who are stable on replacement therapy (i.e., thyroxine or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy that meets concomitant medication restrictions) are allowed\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any other significant condition(s) that would make participation in this protocol unreasonably hazardous\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ASTX660 (tolinapant) and eribulin mesylate are anti-cancer agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ASTX660 (tolinapant) and eribulin mesylate, breastfeeding should be discontinued until 2 weeks after the mother's last dose of study drugs\n* The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest\n* Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias, or taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval\n* Patients unable to stop using any medication which is a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer within 2 weeks of the start of the study",

No randomisation is required. The first five patients to start initiate the trial will be dosed with 100 mg. The subsequent five patients initiating the trial will be dosed with 200 mg.\n\nFor each subject, the study duration will last a total of approximately 14-16 weeks consisting of a screening period of 2-4 weeks, a treatment period of 4 weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.\n\nThe subjects who have previously completed 28 days treatment with 100 mg MBF-118 and did not show any serious adverse effects will have the option to participate to an open-label 90-day extension phase. The extension phase will last approximately 19-21 weeks consisting of up to 21 days screening, 90 treatment days and 42 follow-up days."

Male or nonpregnant, nonlactating females, age 18-75. Males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control measures during the study. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to Visit 2 and either be sexually abstinent or must use a hormonal (oral, implantable, or injectable) or double barrier method of birth control throughout the study, and until 60 days after the last dose of study drug. Females unable to bear children must have documentation of such in the source records (i.e., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or postmenopausal \\[defined as a minimum of 1 year since the last menstrual period\\]).\n  2. Diagnosis of CD based on clinical, endoscopic, and histologic evidence established at least 3 months prior to Screening.\n  3. Has mild to severe ileal and/or colonic CD.\n  4. Participant has no more than 4 na\u00efve or anastomotic small bowel strictures by MRE or IU in the terminal ileum at Screening. A stricture is defined as:\n\n     1. localized luminal narrowing (luminal \u2264 50% relative to normal adjacent bowel); AND\n     2. wall thickening (\u2265 125% relative to adjacent bowel); AND\n     3. length \\< 20 cm\n  5. If participants are using a treatment for CD, they should be on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study commencement. Acceptable treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anti-inflammatory biologics.\n  6. Ability to participate fully in all aspects of this clinical trial. Full comprehension of consent language and written informed consent must be obtained from the participant and documented.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants who exhibit any of the following conditions are to be excluded from the study:\n\n1. CD-related complications:\n\n   * Previous ileorectal anastomosis, or a proctocolectomy. Patients who have received colonic resection are allowed in this study.\n   * Short bowel syndrome\n   * Ileostomy, colostomy, small bowel stoma, or ileoanal pouch\n   * Fistulae in or adjacent to an ileal stenosis. Participants with perianal fistulae could be included if not septic. Participants with internally penetrating fistulae are excluded.\n   * Suspected or diagnosed active intra-abdominal or perianal abscess that has not been appropriately treated\n   * Toxic megacolon\n2. Use of corticosteroid treatment for symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease within the last 2 weeks. Corticosteroids should not be taken during the screening, treatment or follow-up periods of the trial.\n3. History or current diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, ischemic colitis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced colitis, idiopathic colitis (i.e., colitis not consistent with CD), radiation colitis, microscopic colitis, colonic mucosal dysplasia, or untreated bile acid malabsorption.\n4. Uncontrolled primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n5. Malignancies or history of malignancy within 5 years of the initial screening visit (V1), except for adequately treated or completely excised non-metastatic basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or cervical carcinoma in situ.\n6. Has a severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, as determined by the investigator.\n7. Patients with cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) stages I to IV congestive heart failure) and patients with prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease.\n8. Clinically significant abnormal clinical laboratory values, vital signs, physical examination, or 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening or Baseline \\[PR \u2265 220 msec, QRS \u2265120 msec and QTc \u2265 440 msec, bradycardia (\\<50 bpm) or clinically significant minor ST wave changes or any other abnormal changes on the screening ECG that would interfere with measurement of the QT interval\\].\n9. Systemic or opportunistic infections including:\n\n   * Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) determined at Screening, defined as a positive QuantiFERON test, or a purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test. Patients who test positive and show symptoms of TB (abnormal chest x-ray, or positive sputum smear or culture, active TB bacteria in his/her body, usually feels sick and may have symptoms such as coughing, fever, and weight loss) will be excluded. Patients positive for TB who develop symptoms during the study period will be removed from the trial. An exception is made for subjects with a history of latent TB who are currently receiving treatment for latent TB, will initiate treatment for latent TB before the first dose of study treatment, or have documentation of completing appropriate treatment for latent TB within 3 years prior to the first dose of study treatment). Patients who test positive for TB during the study period but who do not show symptoms will be allowed to continue the study.\n   * Active infection with HIV.\n   * Evidence of positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). NOTE: if a participant tests negative for HBsAg, but positive for HBcAb, the participant would be considered eligible if no presence of HBV DNA is confirmed by HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction reflex testing performed in the central laboratory.\n   * Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) (positive HCVAb and HCV RNA). Note: Participants who are HCVAb positive without evidence of HCV RNA may be considered eligible (spontaneous viral clearance or previously treated and cured).\n   * Evidence of Clostridioides difficile toxin or treatment for C. difficile infection, or other intestinal bacterial pathogen, within 30 days prior to Screening.\n   * History of invasive fungal infections such as Candida or Aspergillus within 6 months prior to randomization.\n   * History of herpes (simplex type 1, simplex type 2, or zoster) infection or reactivation within 12 weeks prior to randomization, or frequent recurrence of herpes (more than 2 times per year).\n   * Evidence of active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection at Screening.\n   * Any other clinically significant extraintestinal infection or opportunistic, chronic, or recurring infection within 6 months before Screening. Examples include, but are not limited to, infections requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics, hospitalization, or prolonged treatment.\n10. Concurrent or previous participation in another clinical trial and received investigational therapy within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Screening. Fecal microbiota transplant (includes human microbiota-based therapeutics) within 4 weeks prior to Screening are allowed.\n11. Any major surgery, in the investigator's opinion, performed within 8 weeks prior to randomization or planned during the study (i.e., any surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia).\n12. Unwillingness to withhold protocol-prohibited medications during the trial.\n13. History of excessive alcohol or drug abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the participant's ability to comply with the study procedures.\n14. Known or suspected allergy, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity or intolerance to the study drug(s) or its' excipients.\n15. Prior enrolment in the current study and had received study treatment.\n16. The participant is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependent relationship with a study site employee who is involved in conduct of this study (e.g., spouse, parent, child, sibling).",

                    "briefSummary": "Stroke, which can occur due to many different reasons and is one of the most common neurological conditions, is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The most common disorders that occur after stroke are motor disorders. In addition, these patients may be accompanied by respiratory problems such as changes in breathing patterns and decreased ventilation function. Respiratory problems are an important risk factor for the development of long-term mortality for both cardiovascular diseases and stroke. With all these changes, there is a serious decrease in the activity performance of the patients. While stroke rehabilitation focuses on motor function losses, problems in pulmonary functions do not receive the necessary attention. Evaluating and treating patients from every aspect in stroke rehabilitation will further increase the effectiveness of the treatments applied.\n\nUltrasonography (USG), which has been used in the field of healthcare for more than 40 years, works with a mechanism based on the principle of sound waves traveling and reflecting at different speeds in tissues of different densities. USG is a very useful and effective imaging method used by modern medicine as a part of examination and patient care, based on its advantages such as sound waves being harmless to living beings because they are non-ionizing, the image being real-time and being viewable at the time of the procedure, being a non-invasive method, and being inexpensive. This study will be included in the literature as an original study in terms of examining both the development of the patients and the effectiveness of the treatment in many aspects, with many parameters obtained by ultrasonography in subacute stroke patients who will receive respiratory muscle training.",
                    "detailedDescription": "According to WHO, stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident, is a neurological condition that results in rapidly developing loss of brain function as a result of a problem in the blood supply to the brain. Stroke, which ranks third among the causes of death, is one of the leading causes of disability. This neurological condition affects not only the periphery but also the respiratory muscles such as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, causing respiratory weakness, changes in breathing patterns, and a decrease in respiratory volume. These changes in breathing lead to a decrease in physical activity and therefore limitation in daily living activities. The decrease in respiratory muscle strength results in an increase in morbidity and mortality due to decreased pulmonary function.\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is the most common non-pharmacological treatment method for pulmonary diseases. PR has been studied extensively in patients with neuromuscular disease or spinal cord injury patients with restrictive pulmonary disease; However, studies in stroke patients with respiratory complications such as pneumonia are limited.\n\nThere are studies in the literature showing that respiratory muscle training applied after stroke has positive effects on various respiratory parameters.\n\nIn this study, the development of the pulmonary muscles with respiratory muscle training after stroke will be followed by ultrasound and functional tests, and the effect of this development on hand grip strength and activity performance, which is an indicator of general muscle strength, will be examined."

                    "briefSummary": "Migraine is a frequent and debilitating neurologic disorder. It is more frequent in women, and more prevalent in patients with autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and endometriosis, whereas patients with long standing type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) - an autoimmune but non inflammatory disease - seem to be less affected compared to the general population. Despite new migraine prevention treatments, a large number of patients remain unresponsive to currently available anti-migraine therapy and migraine pathophysiology remains unclear. Several peptides (calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-38 (PACAP-38), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)) and hormones (estrogens, prolactin) and the immune system play an important role in migraine pathophysiology. Among T lymphocytes, regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress inflammation. Studies have evidenced higher levels of inflammatory molecules (cytokines) in migraine patients and have suggested decreased proportions of Treg cells in migraine, as well as in MS, RA, CD and SLE, whereas inflammation declines and Treg levels seem increased in long-standing T1DM. Inflammation, which participates in migraine pain, seems to be a common factor for migraine and these diseases. However, these studies display conflicting results and further investigation is required to better understand the mechanisms behind migraine.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will compare Treg levels, as well as identify Treg subpopulations and measure cytokine levels in migraine and migraine-free participants with and without an autoimmune/inflammatory disorder (MS, RA, CD, SLE, T1DM and endometriosis).",
                    "detailedDescription": "Migraine is the 6th most frequent disease (14% of the population) and the second leading cause of disability worldwide. From puberty and onward, migraine is 2 to 3 times more frequent in women, which also suffer from more severe attacks. Migraine is also up to twice as prevalent in patients suffering from autoimmune or inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn disease (CD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and endometriosis, whereas patients with long standing type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) - an autoimmune but non inflammatory disease - seem to be less affected compared to the general population.\n\nDespite the identification of the role of peptides such as CGRP in migraine pathophysiology and the development of targetted anti-CGRP treatments, many patients remain unresponsive and the mechanisms behind migraine are still unclear.\n\nThe trigemino-vascular system is involved in the perception of migraine pain. Migraine occurs with trigemino-cervical neuron sensitization, leading to peptide secretion (such as CGRP, PACAP-38 and VIP), which induce neurogenic inflammation that is responsible for vasodilation, capillary leakage, oedema and further sensitization of the trigemino-vascular system, leading to amplified perception of migraine pain. CGRP, PACAP-38 and VIP infusions all induce migraine attacks in migraine patients, and only mild or no headache in healthy volunteers.\n\nSex hormones, prolactin and insulin are also involved in migraine pathophysiology, and the immune system, through cytokine production and immune cell dysregulations seems to also play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Both are closely related as sex hormone levels may have an influence on the levels of certain immune cell subtypes. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-6) were shown to be elevated in migraine patients but also inflammatory diseases such as MS and endometriosis compared to controls and are associated with migraine pathophysiology. Inflammation seems to be a common factor for migraine and these diseases. However, these studies provide conflicting results and further investigation is needed to better understand the role of inflammation in migraine pathophysiology.\n\nAmong T lymphocytes, regulatory T (Treg) cells regulate inflammation by suppressing effector T cells through several suppressive mechanisms such as IL-10 secretion or the hydrolysis of pro-inflammatory and nociceptive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive adenosine by cluster of differentiation (CD) 39 and 73 enzymes on the Treg cell surface. Recent studies have suggested decreased Treg proportions in migraine patients, particularly CD 39 and CD 73-positive Treg cells, whereas Treg cells were shown to be increased in T1DM patients. This suggests the role of Treg cells in migraine, but further studies are needed.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aim to compare Treg levels, as well as identify Treg subpopulations and measure cytokine levels in migraine and migraine-free participants with and without an autoimmune/inflammatory disorder (MS, RA, CD, SLE, T1DM and endometriosis). This will provide better understanding of migraine pathophysiology and lead to the development of targeted and personalized treatment strategies, according to the immune pain profile and associated inflammatory diseases of migraine patients."

                    "briefSummary": "Obesity and related metabolic comorbidities have been associated with more than a 4-fold increased risk of incident cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Dysfunctional metabolic flexibility is increasingly recognized as a critical mechanism linking metabolic risk factors to risk of cognitive impairment, although few studies portable behavioral strategies to enhance metabolic function among individuals at risk for ADRD. The present study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week time restricted feeding intervention among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Changes in cognitive and metabolic function will also be examined.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Obese older adults with mild cognitive impairment with mild cognitive impairment will be asked to participate in a 12 week time restricted fasting intervention. Working with a behavioral psychologist, they will adapt the timing their eating patterns to incorporate 2-3 days per week with a 16 hour fasting period, typically lasting from after dinner to lunch the next day. The behavioral intervention will titrate fasting using established behavioral change techniques, with early phase sessions focusing on organizational principles to prepare for weekly fasting scheduling and acceptance-based psychological coping skills, including the ability to tolerate symptoms of hunger and discomfort that may accompany fasting. After treatment initiation, sessions will focus on broadening fasting behaviors for flexible adoption across different contexts and to enhance maintenance of fasting patterns. At baseline and following treatment, participants will undergo tests of cognitive and metabolic function to assess memory, executive function, metabolic flexibility, and inflammation. At both time points, participants will also undergo an abbreviated assessment of cognitive and metabolic function under fasting conditions to assess for any cognitive weaknesses unmasked during periods of brief metabolic 'stress'."

                    "detailedDescription": "Mechanical ventilation is a life-supporting therapy that intrinsically induces diaphragm rest. Consequently, mechanical ventilation induces time-dependent diaphragm weakness in animals and in critically ill patients, and is referred to as ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD).\n\nIn most cases with VIDD, the decrease in diaphragm thickness can be detected by bedside Ultrasonography. The onset of diaphragm atrophy in the intensive care unit could be very rapid (fewer than 5 days). Vivier E. defined muscle atrophy as greater than or equal to a 10% decrease in muscle thickness on day 5 compared to day 1. It's found that diaphragm atrophy occured in 17/35 (48%). However, There is always some cases presented an increase in diaphragm thickness. Goligher EC. reported that approximately 20% of mechanically ventilated patients exhibit an increase in diaphragm thickness. In our previous study, there were about 46.7%(14/30) of ventilated children had increased diaphragmatic thickness. It's supposed that the thickening might associated with the diaphragm injury during mechanical ventilation.\n\nEarly mobilization may enhance the weaning of ventilated children, so the investigators hypothesize that the percentile of cases with increase diaphragmatic thickness will decline by early mobilization. To investigate this hypothesis, investigators are conducting a randomized trial examining the effects of early mobilization versus routine care on changing tendency of diaphragm thickness.\n\nEnrolled children requiring mechanical ventilation will be randomized to either early mobilization group or routine care group. Diaphragm thickness will be measured by ultrasound on day1, day3, day5 and day7 after intubation and subsequently diaphragm thickness changing tendency will be calculated in each arm. The operator acquiring ultrasound images will be blinded to the care mode that the subject was randomized to. Subjects in the study will follow standard ICU sedation awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials. The medical team in charge of the subject will determine when the subject is safe to receive early mobilization according to the standard established along with the rehabilitation team."
