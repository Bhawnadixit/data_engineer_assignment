                    "briefSummary": "The investigators will conduct a fully controlled dietary randomized crossover trial (RCT) including 10 adults with HeFH using lipid-lowering medication to investigate the impact of a diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods, reflecting Canada's Food Guide, in place of a standard North-American diet on LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and the plasma metabolome.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The dietary intervention will be undertaken as a crossover RCT at the Institute on nutrition and functional foods (INAF, Laval University) in Quebec City. Participants (men and women with genetically-defined HeFH) will consume in a random order a fully-controlled diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods, reflecting Canada's Food Guide principles (CFG diet in further sections), and a standard North American diet (NAD diet; i.e. control diet), reflecting current dietary intakes of French-Canadians, for 4 weeks each, and separated by a 4-week washout period.\n\nOnce enrolled, participants will provide a blood sample and complete a self-administered, validated web-based food-frequency questionnaire. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the CFG-NAD or NAD-CFG diet sequence, using a computer-assisted program. The randomization (1:1) will be stratified by sex and LDL-receptor (LDLR) genotype. The two diets will be consumed for 4 weeks and separated by a 4-week washout period. During diet phases, all meals and foods will be provided to ensure optimal diet control using a 7-day cyclic menu. The CFG diet emphasizes low intakes of red and processed meats and high intakes of minimally processed plant foods with water as the drink of choice, as per Canada's Food Guide. The NAD diet reflects current dietary intakes of the French-Canadian adult population in terms of foods, nutrients, and diet quality, as characterized in recent surveys conducted in an age- and a sex-representative sample of adults from the Province of Quebec. An experienced food technician will prepare the diets. Each food and ingredient will be weighed with a precision of \u00b10.1 g.\n\nOn weekdays, subjects will visit INAF Clinical Research Unit to consume their lunch meal under the research coordinator's supervision. At that time, they will also be given their evening meals and the next day's packaged breakfast to take home. Weekend meals will be provided at the Friday visits. A checklist will be provided to all participants to identify the consumed foods.Alcohol, vitamin supplements, and natural health products will not be allowed. Tea and coffee (black) will be allowed (\u22642 servings/day without daily fluctuations). Participants will be instructed to maintain their usual physical activity level. At the end of each diet, fasting plasma samples will be collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. Parts of the samples will be stored at -80\u2103 for future ancillary analyses. Participants' anthropometry, body composition (DEXA scan), and blood pressure will be measured. To incorporate gender aspects associated with the intervention in knowledge transfer activities, subjects' appreciation of the diets will be assessed using visual analog scales filled after each meal on day 7 and 28 of each diet.\n\nObjective 1: To investigate the impact of a diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods in place of a standard North American diet on LDL-C concentrations - the primary treatment target in HeFH management. This objective will output a convincing demonstration of the cholesterol-lowering effects of diet in adults with HeFH, supporting the effectiveness of dietary interventions in HeFH management. Investigators will compare post-diet LDL-C levels (primary outcome) using mixed models for repeated measures. Secondary outcomes include other atherogenic lipoproteins and lipids (apolipoprotein B, non-HDL-C, total-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a)) and other cardiovascular disease risk factors (fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, FH risk score, 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease). Potential effect modification by key participant characteristics (age, BMI, sex, LDLR genotype, lipoprotein (a) and diet sequence) will also be tested.\n\nObjective 2: To assess the impact of a diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods in place of a standard North American diet on the plasma metabolome. This objective serves a dual purpose as it will: 1. inform on the dietary impact on systemic metabolism, beyond its impact on LDL-C levels, further supporting the importance of healthy dietary habits in HeFH; and 2. allow the identification of an unbiased HeFH-specific plasma metabolomic signature of a diet low in red and processed meats and high in plant foods to be used as an objective proxy of diet adherence. To document post-diet differences in plasma metabolome and identify the metabolomic signature of the CFG diet, investigators will derive a reproducible multi-metabolite model discriminating the post-CFG/post-NAD metabolomic profiles.\n\nResults will fill key gaps on the short- and long-term influence of diet on cardiovascular health in HeFH."

                    "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to understand how standing and sitting balance control is altered after spinal cord injury and how a new type of robotic assistive device may be used with spinal stimulation to improve muscle function. The investigators will be testing a device called the Tethered Pelvic Asist Device (or \"TPAD\") in this study. The TPAD may be helpful in two ways. It can be used to help control and support of the trunk, pelvis, and knees during stand training. Also, the TPAD can be used as a training tool by providing controlled \"pushes\" or \"perturbations\" that must be corrected by the person with spinal cord injury in order to maintain proper posture and upright balance. This could be helpful for improving muscle function after spinal cord injury.\n\nParticipants will be placed into one of two groups based on availability and preference. Group 1 will receive TPAD training with stimulation and assessments with and without stimulation. Participation in this group lasts approximately 4 months. Group 2 will only receive assessments with and without stimulation. Participation in this group last approximately 3 weeks.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The aims of the proposed study are to (a) examine the muscle activation patterns generated during stable and perturbed standing in spinal cord injured individuals using spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) and robotic TPAD-assistance or self-assistance for balance, and (b and c) to examine the effectiveness of TPAD-assisted stand training in the improvement of postural control during stable and perturbed standing and sitting in spinal cord injured individuals using spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES).\n\nThe Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) is a light-weight cable-driven robotic stand trainer that (i) can provide assistance-as-needed by applying corrective forces on the trunk and pelvis in response to their movement outside a pre-programmed area, and (ii) can apply controlled forces on the trunk and pelvis to perturb them from their nominal configuration during standing.\n\nA total of 20 spinal cord injured participants who were previously implanted with a scES unit will be enrolled in this study. They will be split into two groups with 10 participants in each. All participants will undergo a physical examination and classification of their spinal cord injury to determine eligibility criteria, which are the same for both groups. Participants will then be placed into one of the two groups based on their availability and preference to be enrolled in a longer or shorter study. Group 1 will consist of individuals with SCI and an scES implant that will receive TPAD training with stimulation and assessments with and without stimulation. Group 2 will consist of individuals with SCI and an scES implant that will only receive assessments with and without stimulation.\n\nEach individual will serve as their own control, to reduce variability. All participants will undergo the Stable Standing Assessment, Postural Perturbation Assessment, Stable Sitting Assessment and Postural Perturbation Assessment in Sitting. Only Group 1 will also perform the Neuromuscular Recovery Scale and attend training sessions with the TPAD system."

The ATS is the sequencing of treatments, which are a behavioral activation therapy (BAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and mobile health (mHealth) tool. The outcomes are to assess the feasibility of the SMART and ATS in the HIV care site and acceptability of the SMART and ATS to patients and clinic staff.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This project proposes to use a SMART to build an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) that has a mobile health (mHealth) tool (text-messaging) to improve adherence to the treatments for depression. The treatments being tested are a behavioral activation therapy (BAT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The outcomes are feasibility of the SMART and ATS in the HIV care site and acceptability of the SMART and ATS to patients and clinic staff. To achieve the overall goal, there are two aims. Aim 1 uses qualitative research methods for the conduct of focus groups and individual interviews with HIV+ Latinos in both English and Spanish. The goal of Aim 1 is to tailor the intervention to the cultural and linguistic needs of Latinos and the organization needs of the HIV clinic study site, which informs Aim 2. Aim 1 is guided by the CDCs Map of Adaptation tailoring framework, which consist of three Action Steps. Action Step 1-3 are to better understand and document: 1) expressions for depression in Spanish and barriers to care, 2) language issues in detecting and reporting depressive symptoms, 3) cultural perspectives of how depression presents as a barrier to care, and 4) attitudes (i.e., cognitive and emotional evaluations) toward BAT and CBT, and text-message preference and confidentiality concerns to promote adherence to the intervention activities. Aim 2 is to build and test a pilot SMART for an ATS - a set of decision rules that uses detectable changes in patient health status to inform the next course of treatment. Successful completion of the proposed study will yield pilot data on the feasibility and acceptability of an ATS for depression integrated into HIV primary care at the University of California San Francisco - Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital."

Greater than 90% adherence to the BAT \\& CBT session schedule;\n2. Responsiveness to text-messages: a) \\>80% of all two-way messages replied back to study line during the set of blocked hours; b) \\>90% of participants reporting direct benefit from one-way text messages;\n3.

                    "briefSummary": "The BOHEMIA program consists of a combination of studies organized around a central community prevention mass drug administration protocol and four sub-studies (i.e.; social science, entomology, health economics, and environmental), each written as an individual protocol. The protocol is central but used in two separate, individually powered trials in Mozambique and Kenya. The trials have been powered on the efficacy outcome and designed to meet the requirements of World Health Organization's (WHO) preferred product characteristics (PPC) for endectocides.",
                    "detailedDescription": "WHO's PPC states that the desired efficacy of an endectocide as stand-alone insecticide in areas of high to moderate transmission is at least 20% reduction in the incidence of clinical malaria (as primary outcome) and incidence of infection (as secondary outcome) in children under 5 years old (the highest incidence age-group in areas with high-transmission), lasting for at least 1 month following a single regimen. Assessing this effect requires a cluster-randomized design with meticulous follow-up of a cohort of children for efficacy and the whole exposed population for safety outcomes, which is the design selected for the BOHEMIA trials.\n\nTwo BOHEMIA cluster randomized trials will be carried out in Mozambique (Southern Africa) and Kenya (Eastern Africa). These sites encompass different transmission dynamics that increase the generalizability of results, namely: (a) a gradient of malaria transmission: moderate in Kenya and very high in Mozambique, (b) different species composition of vector population, (c) different rain patterns and environmental conditions, and (d) different livestock species and human/livestock ratios (in Mozambique).\n\nPopulation:\n\nCo-primary objectives are determined in different populations. Efficacy is primarily determined in a pediatric active cohort (children under 5 years of age in Mozambique and 5-15 years in Kenya), and safety is determined in anyone who receives the drug. Pregnant women and children under 15 kgs are not eligible for treatment.\n\nTreatment Groups:\n\nTwo groups of clusters (three in Mozambique) will be randomized to receive (a) ivermectin in humans, (b) ivermectin in humans + livestock (only in Mozambique), or (c) albendazole control. In Mozambique, the study district will be subject to enhanced passive surveillance for malaria.\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n\nThe primary outcome measure is proposed as incidence in a six-month period given that ivermectin is a short-acting intervention with \\<1% residual drug at 30 days after each dose. Efficacy assessment will continue 4 months post last dose of ivermectin, and this will include analysis of the vector population. We have proposed the appropriate duration of impact evaluation relevant to the biology of the intervention, and geared towards being able to clean the data, lock the database, and conduct the primary efficacy and safety analysis efficiently.\n\nEstimated Duration of Study:\n\nThroughout the study there will be two different groups of participants enrolled, the ones receiving the treatment (\\>15 kg) and the ones in the active pediatric cohort for the main outcome of malaria incidence (the ages of highest incidence in each country, under 5 years of age in Mozambique and 5-15 years in Kenya). Each group will participate for different periods of time.\n\nOnly the group enrolled in the active pediatric cohort will contribute to the primary efficacy outcome and this group will participate from date of first dose for six months. The group receiving treatment (\\>15 kg) will contribute to the primary safety outcome and several secondary outcomes (PK, Neglected Tropical Diseases \\[NTDs\\]) and this group will participate for four months. Women of child-bearing age will be visited one month after the third dose for a final pregnancy test, any pregnancy occurring during the trial will be followed until birth. The cross-sectional survey will enroll participants of all ages one month after the last Mass Drug Administration (MDA) round.\n\nWHO guidance states that trial design and duration should reflect the nature of the intervention and are left at the discretion of researchers. These trials are robustly powered and are being conducted in moderate to high burden areas, so we believe the risk of failing to find an effect is low and if so, it would throw the utility of the intervention into question.\n\nAdvancing the development of this new tool towards implementation in the field can be accomplished in a time frame to contribute to the 2030 Global Technical Strategy (GTS) goals."

In this context, the aim of the research is to develop a simulation-based child and family communication training program. The study aims to evaluate the effect of this communication practice on the communication and problem-solving skills of pediatric nurses. The research is designed as a quasi-experimental study. The study sample will consist of 48 nurses working in pediatric clinics. The nurses, who will receive information about the simulation laboratory, will be divided into groups of 3, and the application will be conducted using a semi-structured scenario in the simulation laboratory. The application will be recorded on video, and feedback will be provided through debriefing sessions based on these recordings. A descriptive data form, a simulation self-assessment scale, a communication skills inventory, and an adult problem-solving scale will be used for data collection. Data will be collected before the application, and at the 1st week and 1st month after the application. As a result of the research, it is aimed to adapt the simulation-based communication skills given to pediatric nurses to the clinical environment.\n\nQuestions of the study;\n\nPediatric nurses before and 1 week and 1 month after simulation-based child and family practice:\n\nIs there a difference between the mean scores of the Communication Skills Inventory? Is there a difference between the mean scores of the Problem Solving Inventory?\n\nPediatric nurses 1 week and 1 month after simulation-based child and family practice:\n\nIs there a difference between the mean scores of the Simulation Self-Assessment Scale?",
                    "detailedDescription": "The research is planned to be conducted as a quasi-experimental study using pre-test-post-test in order to examine the effect of simulation-based applied training for children and families on the communication and problem solving skills of pediatric nurses. The research will be conducted in the pediatric simulation laboratory of Gazi University Faculty of Nursing, Department of Pediatric Nursing. Pediatric Nursing Practice Laboratory consists of two application areas. In the first application area, there is a simulation room and a control room used by the instructors, where student practices are observed and evaluated through mirror glass. The second application area is used to evaluate the analysis phase and feedbacks of the participants' applications, which are videotaped after the simulation applications, by coming together with the participants after the application. The research sample will consist of 48 nurses who work with pediatric patients in a private hospital and agree to participate in the study. After obtaining the necessary permissions for the study, a 4-hour pre-application will be made with a different group of nurses not included in the study and all modules and forms will be applied. The necessary arrangements identified will be made before the application. Simulation application groups will be formed with groups of 3 people on a predetermined day and time according to the working days and hours of the nurses who agree to participate in the study. Before the simulation application, the pediatric simulation laboratory will be introduced to the nurses who agree to participate in the study. The orientation of the nurses to the simulation environment, the materials to be used and the characteristics of the model (expected goal, what they are asked to do, application time, evaluation) will be provided. The pre-created semi-structured scenario for the themes determined before the simulation application will be explained to the nurses. The simulation practice will last approximately 1.5 hours (40 min simulation practice + 50 min debriefing = 1.5 hours). During the implementation, the scenario will be realized with video shooting. While the researchers will manage the scenario, they will take notes on the practices of the nurses. After the simulation application, feedback will be provided to the nurses about the positive aspects and skills that need to be developed by the researchers through a debriefing interview over the video recordings. The data obtained will be evaluated using SPSS 25.0 package program. Data will be evaluated by descriptive analysis (percentage, frequency). The confidence interval will be accepted as 0.95. In the study, firstly, it will be evaluated whether the data obtained show normal distribution or not. Pre-test and post-test scale scores will be analyzed and evaluated with t-test for dependent groups. The cause and effect relationship between the scales will be analyzed by regression analysis. In the analysis of the results, the findings will be considered statistically significant if p\\<0.05."

The first form, which was used as the \"Communication Skills Assessment Scale\" developed by Korkut (1996) with 70 items, was revised as the 45-item \"Communication Skills Inventory\" by Ersanl\u0131 and Balc\u0131 in 1998 after its validity and reliability was established. The inventory is a 5-point Likert scale. Opposite each statement, there are frequency expressions as \"always (5), usually (4), sometimes (3), rarely (2), never (1)\". The highest score that can be obtained from the inventory is 225 and the lowest score is 45. The total score obtained from the inventory shows the general communication skill level of the person. In addition, each sub-dimension of the inventory can be evaluated separately. A high score indicates a high level of communication skills.

Items 9, 22 and 29 of the inventory are not included in the scoring. The Turkish validity and reliability of the inventory was conducted by \u015eahin, \u015eahin, and Heppner (1993). The usability study for nurses was conducted by Erenler (2007). A high score obtained from the inventory indicates that the individual perceives himself/herself as inadequate in problem solving skills.

                    "briefSummary": "This phase III trial studies the side effects and how well risk-based therapy works in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed liver cancer. Surgery, chemotherapy drugs (cancer fighting medicines), and when necessary, liver transplant, are the main current treatments for hepatoblastoma. The stage of the cancer is one factor used to decide the best treatment. Treating patients according to the risk group they are in may help get rid of the cancer, keep it from coming back, and decrease the side effects of chemotherapy.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) in children with stage I (non-pure fetal histology \\[PFH\\], non-small cell undifferentiated \\[SCU\\]) and stage II (non-SCU) hepatoblastoma treated with surgical resection followed by 2 cycles of cisplatin, fluorouracil, and vincristine sulfate (C5V).\n\nII. To determine the feasibility and toxicity of adding doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) to the chemotherapy regimen of C5V for children with intermediate-risk hepatoblastoma.\n\nIII. To estimate the response rate to vincristine (vincristine sulfate), irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride), and temsirolimus in previously untreated children with high-risk, metastatic hepatoblastoma.\n\nIV. To determine whether timely (between diagnosis and end of second cycle of chemotherapy) consultation with a treatment center with surgical expertise in major pediatric liver resection and transplant can be achieved in 70% of patients with potentially unresectable hepatoblastoma.\n\nV. To foster the collection of tumor tissue and biologic samples to facilitate translational research and to provide data that may aid in risk-adapted approaches for subsequent clinical trials.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the EFS of patients with stage I PFH treated with surgery alone. II. To determine whether orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can be accomplished after successful referral and completion of 4 cycles of initial chemotherapy.\n\nIII. To estimate the 2-year EFS for patients once identified as candidates for possible OLT, the 2-year EFS for patients referred to a transplant center that are resected without OLT, and the 2-year EFS for patients referred to a transplant center who receive OLT.\n\nIV. To register children with hepatoblastoma who receive OLT with PLUTO (Pediatric Liver Unresectable Tumor Observatory), an international cooperative registry for children transplanted for liver tumors.\n\nV. To determine if pretreatment extent of disease (PRETEXT) grouping can predict tumor resectability.\n\nVI. To monitor the concordance between institutional assessment of PRETEXT grouping and PRETEXT grouping as performed by expert panel review.\n\nVII. To estimate the proportion of stage IV patients who have surgical resection of metastatic pulmonary lesions.\n\nVIII. To determine the proportion and estimate the EFS of patients with potentially poor prognostic factors including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) \\< 100 ng/mL at diagnosis, microscopic positive surgical margins, surgical complications, multifocal tumors, microscopic vascular invasion, macrotrabecular histologic subtype, and SCU histologic subtype.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups according to risk group.\n\nVERY LOW-RISK GROUP: Patients undergo surgery and receive no further treatment.\n\nLOW-RISK GROUP: (regimen T) Patients undergo surgery and then receive adjuvant cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 6 hours on day 1, fluorouracil IV over 2-4 minutes on day 2, and vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nINTERMEDIATE-RISK GROUP: (regimen F) (closed to accrual as of 3/12/2012) Patients receive C5VD chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, fluorouracil IV over 2-4 minutes on day 2, vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 2, 9, and 16, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo surgical resection after course 2 OR surgical resection or liver transplantation after course 4 of C5VD. Patients may also receive dexrazoxane IV over 5-15 minutes on days 1-2 of courses 5 and 6.\n\nHIGH-RISK GROUP: (regimen W) (regimen W replaced by regimen H as of Amendment 3B) Patients receive up front VI chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment with VI repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease response then receive 6 courses of C5VD with 1 courses of VI in between each 2-course block. Patients with no disease response receive 6 courses of C5VD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nHIGH-RISK GROUP: (regimen H) Patients receive up front VIT chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5, and temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment with VIT repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease response then receive 6 courses of C5VD with 4 courses of VIT in between each 2-course block. Patients with no disease response receive 6 courses of C5VD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor resection or liver transplant after course 4 of C5VD followed by 2 courses of adjuvant C5VD. Patients may also receive dexrazoxane IV over 5-15 minutes on days 1-2 of courses 5 and 6.\n\nAfter completion of study therapy, patients who receive chemotherapy are followed up periodically for at least 4 years."

The investigator should have made the choice of treatment (NEXAVAR) according with the Japanese Package Insert prior to enrolling the patient in this study.\n\nThe enrollment period is of 9 months. The observation period for each patient starts when the therapy with NEXAVAR is initiated. Patients will be followed for 9 months or until it is no longer possible (e.g. lost to follow-up); this will be considered the standard observation period. Those patients, to whom a total of 24 month follow up is possible, information on effectiveness including treatment duration and survival status of the patient and of keratoacanthoma and/or squamous cell cancer development will be collected."
