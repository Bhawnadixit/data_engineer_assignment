                    "briefSummary": "The cesarean section is a common gynecological surgery, requiring effective pain management to prevent complications and immobility. Inadequate pain control can lead to longer hospital stays, higher readmission rates, and dissatisfaction with healthcare. Traditional analgesics, such as opioids, have proven effective in alleviating pain, but they can cause side effects. Therefore, researchers are exploring compounds that can reduce opioid analgesic needs and improve pain control. Quercetin has anti-nociceptive effects in rodent models of chronic pain, including inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain. There are limited clinical studies on the effect of quercetin on acute or chronic pain. The current study is designed to assess the efficacy of preoperative quercetin administration in acute post-operative pain following cesarean section.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The cesarean section is a common gynecological surgery, accounting for 40-50% of deliveries in public hospitals. Effective pain management following a cesarean delivery is crucial, as inadequate control can hinder a mother's capacity to care for her newborn. Uncontrolled postoperative pain can lead to patient immobility, increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications. Failure to adequately manage pain can result in economic and medical issues, including longer hospital stays, higher readmission rates, increased patient recovery costs, and patient dissatisfaction with the quality of healthcare provided.\n\nOpioid medications, particularly when administered via injection, have proven effective in alleviating acute pain, but they are associated with dose-related side effects. Therefore, it is prudent to investigate compounds that can potentiate the analgesic effects of opioids, enabling improved pain control while minimizing opioid consumption. Quercetin, a flavonoid and polyphenol found in various plants and fruits, has been studied for its anti-inflammatory, free radical scavenging, antidiabetic, anticancer, cardiovascular, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, antiplatelet, antibacterial, and anti-obesity effects. Recent evidence indicates quercetin possesses anti-nociceptive effects in rodent models of chronic pain, including inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, and cancer pain.\n\nQuercetin has great potential for clinical use in pain treatment, as its safety is well established. However, there are limited clinical studies on the effect of quercetin on acute or chronic pain. The current study aims to assess the efficacy of preoperative quercetin administration in acute post-operative pain following cesarean section."

Data will be collected in the course of routine clinical practice or following local standard practice guidelines. No procedures or treatments will be mandated by this study, patients will receive usual clinical care.\n\nThe patient population will include all adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ATTR-CM after 01 June 2019 and who meet eligibility criteria. The index date of each patient will be the date of the first documented ATTR-CM diagnosis. The observation period for each patient will range from the index date to whichever occurs first of death, patient withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or end of data collection. The end of data collection (ie, the end of study) is planned for 12 months after the end of the enrollment period.\n\nAs this study is descriptive in nature with no hypothesis testing, the study size will be based on the number of eligible ATTR-CM cases identified in the medical records and meeting the eligibility criteria. Approximately 350 patients diagnosed with ATTR-CM across approximately 17 sites in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Malaysia are planned to be enrolled.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Study variables will include demographic and clinical characteristics of the ATTR-CM patients at diagnosis, including age, sex, physical measurement, relevant medical history and comorbidities, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, prior prescription of heart and CV medication, type of ATTR-CM (ATTRwt or ATTRm), and diagnosis parameters. Exposure variables will include treatment type, treatment regimen/patterns, and concomitant medications. Outcome variables will provide information on death (status and reasons), hospitalizations (status and reasons), imaging and lab assessments, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and healthcare resource utilization (eg, days of hospitalization, frequency of emergency department visits). All relevant data will be collected from the index date to the end of the observation period.\n\nData will be obtained from all information that is available at the site in the patients' electronic medical records and medical charts (eg, consultation notes, discharge summaries, laboratory test results, recorded prescription data, and any other documentation of communication with other health care providers). All data will be collected by trained site personnel and entered directly into web-based electronic case report forms (eCRFs)."

                    "briefSummary": "There is a tremendous clinical need for a noninvasive technique that can assess gastric electrical activity and would be repeatable without any exposure to radiation. Investigators developed a new technique allowing to use noninvasive methods to assess bioelectrical activity in the gastrointestinal system. This has enabled to characterize the normal and pathologic physiology of the stomach through the use of noninvasive magnetogastrogram (MGG) records. Primary hypothesis for this proposal is that analysis of gastric slow wave uncoupling and propagation in multichannel MGG discriminates between normal and pathological gastric electrical activity. Eventually, investigators envision this research leading to new insights for gastrointestinal conditions such as gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia and chronic idiopathic nausea that would inform clinical management of these debilitating diseases.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Studies have demonstrated that the magnetogastrogram (MGG) records the same gastric slow wave activity that detect with serosal and mucosal electrodes. The upgraded magnetometer will improve the spatial resolution resulting in increased sensitivity for detecting and characterizing both abnormal frequency dynamics and abnormal spatiotemporal patterns. The spatiotemporal data collected with multichannel Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) biomagnetometer has allowed , for the first time, to characterize propagation of the gastric slow wave noninvasively. In addition to frequency dynamic changes, which are the only reliable parameters from cutaneous electrogastrogram (EGG), and which still do not necessarily correlate well with disease, the MGG reflects normal and abnormal gastric slow wave activity. Furthermore, for the first time, investigators have demonstrated that propagation characteristics determined magnetically distinguish normal subjects from patients with gastroparesis. Also for the first time, investigators have been able to detect the gradient in gastric propagation velocity noninvasively in animal subjects. However, investigators still have unresolved questions about how MGG propagation rhythm and pattern disturbances may specify functional disorders."

                    "briefSummary": "This study is designed to evaluate the effects of a pain neuroscience education program in pain perception, wellness and pain catastrophizing of youth athletes. For this, an experimental study with an intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG) is designed. During 12 weeks of the 2022-2023 season, CG will receive a self-care education program, with information about health habits in the sport (rest, nutrition, body care and recovery). Meanwhile, IG will also receive a pain neuroscience education program, with information about biological, psychological and perceptual aspect of pain in the sports context. The study will be developed in the Sport High Performance Centre of Balearic Islands, from January to May. All athletes from this sports centre will be invited to participate in the study throughout an e-mail invitation from their sport regional federation. Prior to the beginning of the study, all participants will sign the inform consent. The Ethical Committee of the local university approved this study (280CER22). One week before intervention period, all athletes will be required to complete questionnaire about sociodemographic and sportive data (age, sex, and sport experience). Body mass and height will be also evaluated. Also, all the athletes will be required to complete three questionnaires about pain level, wellness and pain catastrophizing. Pain level and wellness will be evaluated prior to the start of the intervention and weekly, until finishing the intervention period. The pain catastrophizing level will be evaluated before and after the intervention period of the study. We hypothesized that those athletes who receive the pain neuroscience education program will increase wellness and decrease pain level and catastrophizing perception compared to those athletes who received a self-care educational program."

The Screening period lasts up to 4 weeks. The Phase 0 (Imaging Period) is used to determine if patient's tumor(s) are still positive for the biomarker, as well as radiation dosimetry with low dose 177Lu-RAD204im (for a period of up to 2 weeks following the first injection of 177Lu-RAD204im), to assess the safety of the drug. Following the 2 week safety assessment, the subject is eligible to enter Phase I (Treatment Period) with gradual dose increases of 177Lu-RAD204tr. The Treatment Period lasts up to 3 cycles every 6 weeks, with additional extension to a maximum study dose interval of 12 weeks to be approved on a case-by-case basis in discussion with study Sponsor. During the Treatment Period, subjects will be assessed for both safety and treatment response using conventional images and clinical laboratory tests."

Participants with a documented history of histopathological confirmed metastatic NSCLC that is unresectable, progressive and for which standard treatment measures are no longer effective.\n4. Participants with a documented history of PD-L1 positive NSCLC. Any number of prior treatment lines are allowed in this study, however at least one of the treatment line(s) must include an anti-PD(L)-1 antibody. Participants with any documented PD-L1 positivity by immunohistochemistry (IHC) without prior treatment with anti-PD(L)-1 antibody may be allowed on a case-by-case basis in discussion with study Sponsor, if it is determined not to put the participant at an increased risk of adverse drug effects and/or interfere with the integrity of study outcome.\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u2264 2.\n6. Participants must have a life expectancy of \\>4 months in the opinion of the Investigator.\n7. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) test and must not be breastfeeding. WOCBP are defined as those who are not surgically sterile or post-menopausal. Female subjects will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. Female subjects \\< 50 years old who meet the criteria for post-menopausal status without previous surgical sterilization should be considered for further investigation with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels to confirm serological post-menopausal status.\n8. WOCBP must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during the study and for 14 days after the last injection of 177Lu-RAD204im and/or 6 months after the last dose of 177Lu-RAD204tr, whichever occurs later. Acceptable methods of contraception are described the Protocol.\n9. Male subjects who are able to father a child must agree to avoid impregnating a partner and to adhere to a highly effective method of contraception during the study and for 14 days after the last injection of 177Lu-RAD204im and/or 6 months after the last dose of 177Lu-RAD204tr, whichever occurs later. All male subjects must agree to not donate sperm during the study and for 14 days after the last injection of 177Lu-RAD204im and/or 4 months after the last dose of Lu-RAD204tr, whichever occurs later. Acceptable methods of contraception are described in the Protocol.\n10. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases are eligible to participate if: they are clinically and radiologically stable (no evidence of progression by imaging; same imaging modality \\[magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan\\] must be used for each assessment) for at least 28 days prior to the first dose of 177Lu-RAD204; and any neurologic symptoms returned to baseline. Note: Subjects with a history of leptomeningeal disease may not participate even if stable clinically.\n11.

History of prior organ transplant.\n2. Any other known, active malignancy, except for treated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients with a history of malignancies of low recurrence potential who have received curative-intent therapy may be approved on a case-by-case basis in discussion with study Sponsor, if it is determined not to put the patient at an increased risk of adverse drug effects and/or interfere with the integrity of study outcome.\n3. Have any medical condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, prevent the participant's full participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures such as participants with severe claustrophobia who are unresponsive to oral anxiolytics, participants with low back pain who cannot lie comfortably on an imaging table, participants who are hyperactive or hyperkinetic such that they cannot tolerate lying still for multiple time point imaging procedures, etc.\n4. Residual toxicity \\> Grade 1 from prior anti-cancer therapy (except alopecia). Participants with \\> Grade 1 toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy may be approved on a case-by-case basis in discussion with study Sponsor, if it is determined not to put the patient at an increased risk of adverse drug effects and/or interfere with the integrity of study outcome.\n5. History of uncontrolled allergic reactions and/or known or expected hypersensitivity to protein therapeutics, 177Lu-RAD204 or any of its excipients.\n6. Inadequate organ functions as reflected in laboratory parameters:\n\n   * Creatinine clearance (calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula, or measured) \\< 60 mL/min or serum creatinine \\>1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   * Platelet count of \\< 75 x 109/L\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\< 1.0 x 109/L\n   * Haemoglobin \\< 9 g/dL\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\> 3 x ULN, or \\> 5 x ULN for patients with known liver metastases\n   * Total bilirubin \\> 1.5 x ULN, except for patients with documented Gilbert's syndrome who are eligible if total bilirubin \u2264 3 x ULN\n   * For participants not taking warfarin or other anticoagulants: international normalized ratio (INR) \u22641.5 or prothrombin time (PT) \u22641.5 x ULN; and either partial thromboplastin time or activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT or aPTT) \u22641.5 x ULN.

Clinically significant cardiovascular disease including but not limited to:\n\n   * Unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening\n   * Clinically significant and/or uncontrolled heart disease such as congestive heart failure requiring treatment (New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade \u2265 2)\n   * Uncontrolled arterial hypertension or unstable clinically significant arrhythmia\n   * Known LVEF \\< 50%\n   * QTcF \\> 470 msec for females and QTcF \\> 450 msec for males on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) or congenital long QT syndrome.\n9. Participation in any other investigational trial at the time of informed consent signature.\n10. Pregnant or lactating women.\n\n    The following exclusion criteria apply to participants in Phase I:\n11. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose of 177Lu-RAD204tr. Exceptions may be approved on a case-by-case basis in discussion with study Sponsor, if it is determined not to put the participant at an increased risk of adverse drug effects and/or interfere with the integrity of study outcome.\n12. Received anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic, herbal therapy, or any investigational therapy or investigational device, within 28 days (or 5 half-lives for biologic/noncytotoxic agents, whichever is shorter), prior to the first dose of 177Lu-RAD204tr. Focal palliative radiotherapy given within 28 days prior to the first dose of 177Lu-RAD204tr may be approved on a case-by-case basis in discussion with the Sponsor, if it is determined not to put the participant at an increased risk of adverse drug effects and/or interfere with the integrity of study outcome. For participants who received radiotherapy more than 28 days prior to the first dose of 177Lu-RAD204tr, efforts should be made to calculate the prior radiation absorbed dose to each critical organ such as the kidneys, liver, lungs, and bone marrow. The absorbed dose limits for critical organs should not exceed the cumulative absorbed dose from the prior radiopharmaceutical and/or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) treatment(s) and the planned course of treatment in this study. Participants who would have cumulative absorbed dose to critical organs exceeded will not be enrolled in the study.\n13. Has had or is scheduled to have major surgery \\< 28 days prior to the first dose of 177Lu-RAD204tr. Elective surgical procedures not considered to put participants at higher risk of AEs may be allowed on a case-by-case basis in discussion with the Sponsor.\n14. Positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n15. Active or chronic hepatitis B or C. Chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C with undetectable viral loads on stable suppression therapy may be allowed on a case-by-case basis in discussion with study Sponsor.\n16. Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the participant at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.\n17. Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness or clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s), including but not limited to active bacterial, fungal, or viral infections requiring systemic therapy.",

Participants receive study treatment for as long as the disease does not worsen (disease progression) for approximately 1 month for up to two courses of treatment, if participants do not experience any unacceptable side effects, and/or until withdrawal of consent.\n* Participants will be followed for 2 years from the date of study registration.\n* It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study/\n* This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\n  * The U.S. FDA has approved selpercatinib, I-131 and rhTSH as a treatment option for this disease.\n  * The combination therapy is investigational as it has not been approved to treat this disease.\n* Selpercatinib, I-131 and rhTSH are standard of care treatment options for thyroid cancer.

                    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants must have histologically- or cytologically-confirmed follicular-derived nonanaplastic thyroid cancer that is metastatic and/or unresectable AND harbors a known oncogenic RET gene fusion, performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified or equivalently accredited diagnostic laboratory.\n* Tumor tissue or liquid biopsy-based next-generation sequencing (NGS), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for RET gene fusion detection will be permitted.\n* Participants \u2265 18 years of age must have measurable disease, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.\n\n  -- Participants 12 to \\<18 years of age may enroll with either evaluable (i.e. anatomically visible tumor on cross sectional imaging, but tumors do not need to be \\>1 cm) or measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.\n* Participants should have no single tumor deposit exceeding 4.0 cm in the greatest dimension.\n* Participants must have RAI-refractory disease, as defined by:\n\n  * The malignant tissue does not concentrate RAI on a whole body scan following radioiodine administration\n  * The tumor tissue has lost the ability to concentrate RAI on a whole body scan following radioiodine administration after previous evidence of uptake at any earlier timepoint,\n  * RAI is taken up in some but not all tumor deposits on a whole body scan following radioiodine administration and/or\n  * There is progressive disease per RECIST v1.1 despite RAI uptake on a whole body scan following radioiodine administration and/or\n  * For patients 12 to \\<18 years of age, there is persistent anatomically visible tumor on cross sectional imaging following prior therapeutic radioiodine administration\n* Participants may have received no more than a total cumulative RAI dose for treatment (not including RAI given for diagnostic purposes only) of 500 mCi (18.5 GBq).\n* Participants must have asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease, as judged by the treating investigator. For example, patients with bone metastasis associated with mild pain not requiring narcotics for pain control, or patients with lung metastasis associated with mild cough that does not limit the participant's activities, may be considered minimally symptomatic. If confirmation of this criterion is needed, discussion with the protocol chairperson is required prior to enrollment.\n* Prior external beam radiotherapy is allowed. For participants with disease limited to a prior radiotherapy field, this must be considered measurable per RECIST v1.1.\n* Participants may have had no more than one prior systemic therapy for RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, including lenvatinib, sorafenib, or other MKIs. This also includes chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy administered within a clinical trial, but does not include I-131 NaI or levothyroxine. Prior RET-specific kinase inhibitor therapy, such as selpercatinib and pralsetinib, is not allowed.\n* At least 28 days must have passed since any prior radiation or major surgery. At least 28 days must have passed since any prior systemic therapy for thyroid cancer, excluding thyroid hormone replacement.\n* Participants must be \u226518 years of age. Patients as young as 12 years of age will be allowed if permitted by local regulatory authorities and institutional review boards.\n\n  -- All patients of 12 to \\< 18 years of age will be asked to provide assent and the legally designated representative will be asked to provide written consent.\n* Participants \u2265 16 years of age must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u2264 1. Participants 12 to \\<16 years of age must have a Lansky Performance Score of \u2265 60.\n* Participants must have a life expectancy greater than 12 months.\n* Participants must have the ability to swallow medications and have no gastrointestinal abnormality that may alter medication absorption.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below. Bloodwork must be collected within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1:\n\n  * leukocytes \u22653,000/mcL\n  * absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651,500/mcL\n  * platelets \u2265100,000/mcL\n  * hemoglobin \u22659 g/dL\n  * total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) OR \\<3.0 x institutional ULN for participants with Gilbert syndrome\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u22642.5 \u00d7 institutional ULN OR \u22645 \u00d7 institutional ULN if the liver has tumor involvement\n  * creatinine \u2264 institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance \u226530 mL/min\n* Participants must have serum potassium, calcium and magnesium levels within institutional range of normal (may be receiving supplements). Bloodwork must be collected within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants on effective anti- retroviral therapy with an undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.\n* For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n* Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Participants with treated brain metastases are eligible if the patient is asymptomatic AND follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression.\n* Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. For example, participants with nonmelanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or malignancy diagnosed \u22652 years previously and not currently receiving anticancer treatment are eligible. Patients receiving adjuvant hormone therapy for breast or prostate cancer with no evidence of disease are eligible.\n* Participants with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.\n* Selpercatinib may impair fertility in men and women. The effects of selpercatinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because selpercatinib as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use highly effective contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Unless not allowed by local regulations, WOCBP who are abstinent (if this is complete abstinence, as their preferred and usual lifestyle) or in a same-sex relationship (as part of their preferred and usual lifestyle) must agree to either remain abstinent or stay in a same-sex relationship without sexual relations with males. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence just for the duration of the trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men with partners who are WOCBP must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during treatment with the study drugs and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug.\n* WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 7 days prior to initiating study treatment, and not be breast-feeding within two months prior to study entry, during treatment, and for \u22651 week after the last dose of study therapy.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who have had chemotherapy, MKI or radiotherapy within 4 weeks.\n* Participants who have had I-131 NaI treatment within 12 months.\n* Participants who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> Grade 1) with the exception of alopecia.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants with symptomatic CNS metastasis or lesions threatening for spinal cord compression are not eligible.\n* Participants with clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or history of Torsades de pointes, history of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to planned start of study treatment, or prolongation of the corrected QT interval by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \\>470 msec on more than one ECG during Screening. Correction of suspected drug-induced QTcF prolongation may be attempted at the investigator's discretion if clinically safe to do so.\n* Participants with uncontrolled hypertension at screening, as defined by \\>160/95 mm Hg.\n* Participants with uncontrolled hypertension at screening may be re-screened after appropriate medical therapy for hypertension.\n* Participants with an active uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection or serious ongoing intercurrent illness, such as hypertension or diabetes, despite optimal treatment, a clinical diagnosis or symptoms of interstitial lung disease, or other serious medical conditions which in the medical judgment of the investigator would prevent the patient from safely participating (screening for chronic conditions is not required).\n* Participants with uncontrolled symptomatic hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.\n* Participants with symptomatic hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia.\n* Participants with active hemorrhage or at significant risk for hemorrhage.\n* Participants who are taking a concomitant medication that is known to cause QTc prolongation ).\n* Participants with clinically significant active malabsorption syndrome or other condition likely to affect gastrointestinal absorption of the drug.\n* Participants with other uncontrolled serous intercurrent illness that would interfere with the ability to proceed with study therapy.",

They can be easily placed in the office and require little maintenance care. However, despite their benefits, pain during insertion remains a barrier for patient uptake. Currently there is no standard of care for pain management during IUD insertion. The aim of this study is to determine whether local anesthetic, in the form of injecting 1 percent lidocaine into the cervicovaginal junction, reduces pain during insertion. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1 percent lidocaine, placebo, or no injection. All patients presenting for IUD placement, regardless of indication, will be offered participation in the study. Following IUD placement, patients will be asked to rate their pain at key \"pain points\" during the procedure as the primary outcome. Other outcomes collected will include provider-related complications, length of time to place IUD, and overall patient and provider satisfaction."

Control (gently tapping the cervicovaginal junction with a capped needle)",

They will place the speculum, and administer either the intervention, placebo, or control and then leave the room after injection-related bleeding has stopped. After 3 minutes, the second provider (Provider B) will enter the room to place the IUD (including sounding and tenaculum placement) and will be unaware of the participant's treatment arm.\n\nA standardized script will be used with all participants: \"You may or not may feel a poke.\"\n\nBoth lidocaine and the control (normal saline) are odorless and clear, minimizing the risk of unblinding. All data will remain blinded until data analysis.",
