                    "briefSummary": "Pelvis ART is a two phase study looking at using adaptive radiotherapy to help reduce toxicity for cancer patients having radiotherapy in the pelvic region.\n\nAdaptive radiotherapy is a new technology that provides the ability to account for daily changes in anatomy. Adaptive radiotherapy also provides a foundation for which radiotherapy margins might be safely reduced.\n\nPhase 1 of this study is looking to see if a radiation therapist centred adaptive workflow can be implemented. If phase 1 of this study is safe and feasible, the study will proceed to phase 2. Phase 2 of the study looks at using adaptive technology to reduce radiation treatment margins. The primary aim of this study is to see whether margin reduced treatment using adaptive radiotherapy can reduce side effects for patients with cancer in the pelvic area.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Despite major technological advancements in the delivery of pelvic radiation therapy including the use of dynamic therapy, image guidance, integrated boosting and stereotactic techniques, toxicity from pelvic radiation remains a significant issue impacting on patient's quality of life and preventing the delivery of higher (and more curative) doses of radiation. Although evidence showed that adaptive radiotherapy demonstrating promising reduction of acute toxicity, the uptake of adaptive radiotherapy remains poor as adaptive radiation therapy is very labour intensive, time consuming and usually requires a radiation oncologist (RO) and Medical Physicist in attendance to review/modify target contours. These practices of daily multi-disciplinary team (MDT) in person attendance is not sustainable in the long term. Since 2021, Royal North Shore Hospital has been treating patients with cancer in the pelvic with Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) and Radiation Therapists (RT) at the site have undergone a rigorous University based Advanced Practitioner training programme. This study aims to evaluate RT-led ART in a randomised trial to assess the safety and feasibility of ART in a two stage phase 3 randomised controlled trial.\n\nIf this study can prove safety and feasibility in the first phase, it will proceed to the second phase of the study which will look at using adaptive radiotherapy to safely reduce CTV and PTV margins. The primary aim of the study will be to measure the difference in combined acute patient reported gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity between ART with margin reduction versus standard radiotherapy. Secondary aims will be to look at differences in clinician and patient reported acute and late GI and GU toxicity, disease free survival locoregional control, location of recurrence, the efficiency of ART including time taken per treatment, radiation dosimetric differences between the treatment arms and patients' perception of ART."

It is hypothesized this will enable the individual to monitor themselves periodically, obtain feedback about their functional ability, receive recommended diet, exercise and physical activity interventions and record the adherence to any intervention. All information can be linked back to the health care professional for official support and intervene when a decline is noticed, in order to prevent frailty from developing. The aim of this study is to find out if providing more support and greater empowerment can help older people improve their functional ability by self-monitoring and personalised interventions.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Participants will be individually randomised using randomisation service on a 1:1 allocation ratio to either group. There will be 4 groups, with differences in the consultation design and online support available.\n\nParticipant assessments consists of questionnaires and physical tasks completed during two visits at the university facilities. During the second visit, a one-hour consultation with a health care professional will take place to develop a twelve-week action plan to promote a healthier lifestyle.\n\nFrailty status will be defined from the Fried frailty phenotype criteria. Exercise status will be based on current physical activity levels and the Short Physical Performance Battery score derived from the chair-stands, gait speed and balance assessments.\n\nParticipants in the experimental group will receive the assessment, and the consultation will aim to promote to empower them, plus access to the online support platform, termed 'FACET'.\n\nParticipants in the empowerment groups are provided with a structured booklet prior to the consultation to help the participant actively contribute to their own intervention programme, whereas in the other groups,the professional will lead the consultation.\n\nParticipants in the online support groups are provided with FACET, which will provide a diary of recommended activities to do, assessments to complete, as well as information about healthy lifestyles, diet and physical activity recommendations. Details on the recommended exercises and diet will be provided (including demonstrations and examples, also sourced from reputable websites) via FACET and will enable the participant to engage with them. The exercises require no special equipment and can be performed without professional supervision. Participants will be able to monitor themselves regularly and progress or amend recommendations to tailor their needs. Progress will also be monitored by the initial assessors and these can also amend the recommendations based on participant feedback. In short, FACET enables the participants in these groups to engage with their own intervention, amend it and set their own priorities, goals and targets, emphasising prudent health care principles.\n\nParticipants in all groups are followed up after 12 weeks.

The selection of placebo as the comparator is considered the gold standard for medication trials. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tirzepatide or placebo, balancing on site and buprenorphine (BUP) formulation (transmucosal vs extended-release).\n\nParticipants will receive tirzepatide or placebo based on randomized assignment, with \"dose escalation\" of placebo following the schedule for tirzepatide and tirzepatide dosing being consistent with prescribing guidelines. Participants will be administered a subcutaneous (SQ) study medication injection weekly and attend weekly research visits through 26 weeks post-randomization with longer research visits at 1, 3, and 6 months post-randomization. A follow-up visit for final safety measures will be completed at week 30, which takes into account tirzepatide's long half-life.\n\nDuration of participation will be approximately 31 weeks for study participants. Participants will be administered study medication and attend weekly research visits through 6 months post-randomization with longer research visits at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-randomization. Participants will be provided with a Fitbit to measure sleep. BUP is not a study medication; participants will receive BUP through their clinical provider. A follow-up visit for final safety measures will be completed at week 30."

After confirming wrist and upper arm circumference, H2-BP is operated by one measurer, while the auscultatory sphygmomanometer is simultaneously operated by two other measurers. Each subject undergoes alternating measurements of H2-BP on one wrist and the auscultatory sphygmomanometer on the same arm until three valid measurement pairs are obtained per subject, with a maximum of eight repetitions allowed. The two auscultatory sphygmomanometer measurers operate independently and cannot see each other's measurements during the test. Measurements are repeated for 10 to 30 minutes until three valid blood pressure values are obtained and recorded. Validity assessment variables are derived from the recorded values to evaluate the accuracy of H2-BP."

Electroacupuncture (EA) received attention as an alternative and complementary treatment method. The low-frequency continuous wave EA and the intermittent wave EA have been used in the management of BP. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of these two electroacupuncture waveforms for different severity groups of BP.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The investigators will recruit 60 patients with BP whose ENoG test indicate a mild to moderate facial nerve damage, as indicated by the ratio of amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the affected side comparing to normal side is 20% or higher. And the investigators will recruit 60 patients with BP whose ENoG test indicate a severe damage, as indicated by the ratio of amplitude of the CMAP of the affected side comparing to normal side is less than 20%. Both the two types of patients will be randomly divided into either the low-frequency continuous wave group, or the intermittent wave group, and receive 4 weeks treatment. The primary outcomes is change from baseline score of the Facial Nerve Grading System 2.0. The secondary outcomes are change from baseline score of the Sunnybrook grading scale, and change from baseline value of the amplitude of the CMAP of the affected side in the ENoG test."

                    "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose to examine whether changes in sleep alter pain and pain-related outcomes in adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). As many as 70% of adults with SCD experience various sleep disturbances. Pain and sleep are inter-related, such that pain disturbs sleep and disturbed sleep amplifies pain and increases risk for developing chronic pain. Pain processing occurs in the central nervous system, where nociceptive input can be inhibited or facilitated and which can undergo both functional and structural plasticity. When plasticity results in amplification of pain, this central sensitization (CS) manifests as hyperalgesia, allodynia, and spreading of pain and is an important treatment target in its own right. A growing literature implicates central sensitization in SCD, and the investigators find a strong association between laboratory-evoked CS and sleep disturbance in SCD. The neural substrates involved in pain modulation are often disrupted in chronic pain, likely due to the demands pain places on cognitive resources, and similar effects are seen with chronic insomnia. It remains unclear whether these changes occur in SCD and if improving sleep improves central modulation of pain. The potential for improved sleep to reduce pain and CS requires additional investigation, particularly given the significance of sleep disturbance as a mutable risk factor. The investigators will conduct a randomized trial in which it will be determined whether improvements in sleep reduce pain and alter brain processing of pain and cognitive stimuli. The aims are to determine whether treatment of sleep improves pain outcomes in SCD and to determine whether treatment of sleep alters functional connectivity of cognitive and pain modulatory networks using brain imaging in SCD."
