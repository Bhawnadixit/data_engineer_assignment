Umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation will be performed first. Children with stable immune reconstruction will than receive islet cell transplantation.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Monogenic immunodeficiency type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) usually onsets in early age and has a long course of treatment. Because of T cell deficiency, patients are prone to recurrent infection, hemorrhage, sepsis, colitis or complications of diabetes mellitus, which lead to early death.\n\nNew clinical treatment schemes have been explored and introduced around the world. Sequential transplantation of umbilical cord blood stem cells and islet cells is the latest treatment method for these children. Early treatment of monogenic immunodeficiency T1DM children can avoid disease-related organ toxicity, infection risk associated with chronic immunosuppression, and possible prevention of autoimmune endocrine organ damage. Thus, sequential transplantation of umbilical cord blood stem cells and islet cells is the only possible cure for those patients currently."

Patients with reported use of ticagrelor within the prior 3 days who require urgent ticagrelor reversal will be eligible for enrollment. These populations will be enrolled based on separate inclusion criteria.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The study will consist of a Screening/Pre-treatment period, an on-site assignment to study treatment and administration, a Follow-up visit on (Day 3+1 and Day 7\u00b11), a Final Follow-up visit (Day 35\u00b13) and a Follow-up visit for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) only patients (Day 90\u00b110). Infusion of PB2452 will be initiated on Day 1 and will continue for approximately 16 hours for a total of 18 g.\n\nOn Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion comprised of an initial IV bolus of 6 grams (g) infused over 10 minutes for rapid reversal, followed immediately by a 6g IV loading infusion over 4 hours and then a 6 g IV maintenance infusion over 12 hours. This bentracimab (PB2452) regimen is expected to provide immediate reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor within 5 minutes of the initiation of infusion that is sustained for 20-24 hours.\n\nIn subjects with potential drug interaction from recent concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors with ticagrelor, an alternative regimen may be used comprising administration of 36 g over an active treatment period of 24 hours and 10 min. (This alternative regimen will be an initial 12 g bolus infusion over 10 minutes, followed immediately by a loading infusion of 12 g over 6 hours which will then be followed by a maintenance regimen of 12 g infused over 18 hours for a total infusion of 36 grams over 24 hours and 10 minutes).\n\nIn patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), brain imaging within 2 hours of initiation of study drug and at least one follow-up brain imaging performed 12-24 hours post completion of PB2452 will be required to support adjudication of hemostasis.\n\nAll subjects may be discharged from the clinical site between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7, if already discharged, and on Day 35 (\u00b1 3 days). All ICH patients must complete End of Study (EOS) Day 35\u00b13 (Visit 5). ICH patients that agree to participate in the ICH-only-90-day-follow-up visit will have an additional visit on Day 90\u00b110 (Visit 6)."

Male or female \\>18 years of age with documented or verbal informed consent. Emergency consent may be obtained where permitted by local regulations and institutional approval.\n2. History or documentation of ticagrelor intake within the prior 3 days\n3. Patients described below who require urgent reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor:\n\nPatients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding, requiring urgent reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. It is expected that enrolled patients would have characteristics similar to those described below:\n\n* Potentially life-threatening bleeding with signs or symptoms of hemodynamic compromise, e.g., systolic blood pressure \\< 90 mm Hg and signs or symptoms of low cardiac output not otherwise explained\n* Bleeding in a critical organ or closed space, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular, pericardial, or intramuscular bleed with compartment syndrome\n* Visible, uncontrolled bleeding associated with a corrected hemoglobin level \\< 8.0 g/dL, a fall in hemoglobin level of \u2265 2.0 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) from a known baseline, or requirement for transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells (PRBC)\n\nPatients requiring urgent surgery or invasive procedure when it is not medically advisable either to proceed urgently with impaired hemostasis or to delay the urgent procedure for 3 or more days due to the high risk of bleeding. These patients may typically be in any of the following clinical situations:\n\n* Requires urgent surgery or invasive procedure known to be associated with a risk of significant bleeding (such as cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, or major orthopedic surgery)\n* Requires urgent surgery or invasive procedure that may have an adverse procedural outcome if hemostasis is impaired (such as neurological, spinal, ophthalmological, urological, or orthopedic surgery)\n* At risk of experiencing life-threatening events, such as, shock, myocardial infarction, or stroke, if significant intraoperative or postoperative bleeding occurs (such as in elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease who have limited cardiopulmonary reserve)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known sensitivity or contraindication to PB2452 or any of its excipients\n2. Patients in whom ticagrelor reversal is not considered urgent, e.g., patients with stable or non-acute conditions who have low hemoglobin due to chronic, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding or who have stable, remote, or asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage\n3. Patients expected to be clinically unsalvageable, such as, patients with end-stage cancer or patients with overwhelming sepsis\n4. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would make it unsafe or unsuitable for the patients to participate in this study. This includes assessment of likelihood to cooperate with study follow-up visits and procedures. Known pregnancy may be exclusionary in some regions or countries as directed by national health authorities and/or local Institutional Review Boards/Ethics Committees\n5. Known use of clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticlopidine within 5 days of study drug administration; known use of antiplatelet GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, or cangrelor within 5 half-lives of expected study drug administration; or known use of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban within 5 half-lives of expected study drug administration\n6.

                    "briefSummary": "Around 90% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at an early stage and approximately 70%, are hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-). Despite advancements in adjuvant endocrine therapy, 20-30 % of early-stage BC patients relapse within the first decade post-surgery. Recent clinically meaningful therapeutic option for these patients has been cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6 inhibitors). Abemaciclib and ribociclib, were assessed in the adjuvant setting, both showing improvement in IDFS. Abemaciclib has been approved by the FDA and EMA for HR+/HER2- early breast cancer at high risk of disease recurrence and is the first addition to Slovenian treatment regimen in routine clinical practice. Poor medication adherence can directly affect the effectiveness of treatment for early HR+/HER2- breast cancer. While adherence data in patients treated with aromatase inhibitors are available, the adherence rate in patients with early HR+/HER2- breast cancer taking abemaciclib is unclear. In this study, investigators hypothesize that patients receiving abemaciclib in combination with aromatase inhibitors will have a lower medication adherence and higher discontinuation rate compared to those receiving aromatase inhibitors alone. It is expected that patient with better quality of life, cognitive functioning and more positive attitude towards their therapy will demonstrate higher medication adherence rate. Adherence rate will also be affected by other factors, such as age and prior treatments.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignant tumour in women, with an estimated 2.308 million new cases and over 665,000 deaths globally in 2022. Around 90% of patients are diagnosed at an early stage and the majority of these cases, approximately 70%, are hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-). Despite advancements in adjuvant endocrine therapy that significantly lower recurrence and mortality rates, 20-30 % of early-stage BC patients experience relapse within the first decade post-surgery. Around 12% of patients with HR+/HER2- BC belong to high-risk population with 5-years invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) of 70.2% vs 90.0% in non-high-risk. The most recent clinically meaningful therapeutic option for these patients has been cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6 inhibitors). Endocrine therapy combined with CDK4/6 inhibitors (abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib) is now the standard, most effective, and recommended treatment for these patients in the first or subsequent lines of treatment for advanced disease. Two CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib and ribociclib, have been assessed also for use in the adjuvant setting (MonarchE and NATALEE study). Both studies showed improvement in IDFS of combined endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor vs endocrine therapy alone. Abemaciclib has been approved by both the FDA and EMA for patients with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer at high risk of disease recurrence and has therefore recently been added to Slovenian current regimen for this indication in routine clinical practice. Non-adherence to adjuvant therapy may compromise the efficacy of combined treatment in preventing disease recurrence and mortality. Some historical data report that only 60-70% of patients with early BC adhere to adjuvant therapy, making adherence a significant challenge. Key factors influencing adherence to cancer treatment include the perceived benefits of the treatment, the setting in which the treatment is administered (at home or in a hospital), the associated risks, the impact on quality of life, and the costs involved. Non-adherence often arises because patients do not experience the immediate benefits. With no visible or measurable signs of the disease and no physical symptoms of the disease, as is the case in patients receiving adjuvant treatment, and given that many would not have experienced a relapse even without adjuvant therapy, patients are much more likely to discontinue treatment if they experience adverse events/reactions (AE). Adherence to treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with aromatase inhibitors differs from some other systemic treatments due to the continuous treatment regimen that lasts for several years without interruption. In early BC, it lasts two (abemaciclib) or three (ribociclib) years and is associated with some specific AEs. Aromatase inhibitors are associated with arthralgias, myalgias, and joint stiffness, whereas CDK4/6 inhibitors with myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms (especially diarrhoea caused by abemaciclib). The duration of treatment, five or more vs two years (aromatase inhibitors as monotherapy vs abemaciclib in combination with aromatase inhibitors, respectively), may lead to different discontinuation rates. Despite the growing amount of real-world experiences with combined treatment with aromatase inhibitors and abemaciclib in the adjuvant setting, there is currently a lack of literature specifically exploring how patient adherence and attitudes are influenced by this combination. This gap underscores the need for further research to fully understand the impact of these therapies on medication adherence. Poor medication adherence can directly affect the effectiveness of treatment for early HR+/HER2- breast cancer. While data on medication adherence in patients taking aromatase inhibitors are available, the adherence rate in patients with early HR+/HER2- breast cancer taking abemaciclib remains unclear. Due to the differing characteristics of these treatment modalities, particularly their distinct safety profiles, medication adherence and persistence may vary between them. It is hypothesized that patients receiving abemaciclib in combination with aromatase inhibitors will have a lower medication adherence and higher discontinuation rate compared to those receiving aromatase inhibitors alone. It's also expected that patient with better quality of life, better cognitive functioning and more positive attitude towards their therapy will demonstrate higher medication adherence rate. Additionally, it's anticipated that other factors, such as age and prior treatments, will also contribute to adherence rates."

It is hypothesized that BAFF CAR-T cells will be safe and will improve SLE disease activity scores.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is an open label, phase 1 dose escalation study designed to establish the safety and RP2D of autologous BAFF CAR-T cells in adults with refractory SLE. The planned dose escalation includes 3 dose levels and one de-escalation level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined using a 3+3 dose escalation design. The MTD dose level cohort may be expanded to a total of 6 patients. RP2D may be selected at dose level(s) at or below the MTD based on all data then available (e.g. efficacy, safety, PK and PD), and additional patients enrolled at these levels to expand up to a total of 40 patients in the study, in order to further evaluate safety and efficacy and guide Phase 2 trial design.\n\nTo ensure patient safety, during dose escalation, treatment of subjects at each dose will be staggered by at least 14 days. For example, the second subject will be enrolled only after the first subject has finished 14 days of safety monitoring from the CAR-T cell infusion, and the third subject will be enrolled only after the second subject has finished 14 days of safety monitoring from the CAR-T cell infusion. In the expansion cohorts, this staggering interval will no longer be required."

Active disease despite use of standard therapy (i) and one or more additional therapies (ii).\n\n  i. Corticosteroids (CS), Hydroxychloroquine ii. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), Methotrexate (MTX), Azathioprine (AZA), Tacrolimus (TAC), Cyclophosphamide (CYC), Rituximab, and/or belimumab b. Active disease due to intolerance of standard therapy (i) and one or more additional therapies (ii).\n\n  c. Steroid-Dependent Disease\n* Subjects must meet organ function criteria:\n\n  1. Creatinine clearance more than or equal to 30 ml/min calculated by the Cockcroft - Gault formula\n  2. Subjects must have adequate cardiac function as defined as left ventricular ejection fraction \u2265 40% on the most recent echocardiogram.\n  3. Adequate pulmonary function with pulse oximetry \u226592% on room air\n  4. Total Bilirubin \u2264 1.5x the institutional upper limit of normal (except in patients with Gilbert's syndrome)\n  5. ALT (SGPT) and AST (SGOT) \\< 3x the institutional upper limit of normal\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* SLE complicated by:\n\n  * Active neuropsychiatric lupus\n  * Active secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH)\n* Presence of any medical or psychological conditions which may affect patient ability to comply with study protocol requirements and study visits\n* Presence of active, untreated infection such as:\n\n  * Active microbial infection. Patients with possible fungal infections must have had at least 2 weeks of appropriate anti-fungal therapy and be asymptomatic. Patients with active tuberculosis must have had at least 4 weeks of appropriate anti-mycobacterial treatment and be asymptomatic.\n  * Active or latent hepatitis B or active hepatitis C (test within 8 weeks of screening), or any uncontrolled infection at screening\n  * HIV positive test within 8 weeks of screening\n* Acute/ongoing neurologic toxicity \\> Grade 1 except for a history of controlled seizures or fixed neurologic deficits that have been stable/improving over the past 1 months.\n* Patients with concomitant genetic syndrome: such as patients with Fanconi anemia, Kostmann syndrome, Shwachman syndrome or any other known bone marrow failure syndrome. Patients with Down Syndrome will not be excluded.\n* Evidence of myelodysplasia or cytogenetic abnormality indicative of myelodysplasia on any bone marrow biopsy prior to initiation of therapy\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because CAR-T cell therapy may be associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CAR-T cells, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. Women of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the CAR-T cell infusion.\n* A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\\< 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).\n* Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* Men who will not agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n* With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the CAR-T cell infusion. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n* With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the CAR- T cell infusion to avoid potential embryonal or fetal exposure. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* Patients receiving a live vaccines within the last two weeks.\n* A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed between prior treatment with investigational agent(s) and the day of lymphocyte collection.\n* Concurrent use of high dose systemic steroids and/or T cell directed immune suppression. Subjects must discontinue T cell targeted therapy \\>3 weeks and wean prednisone dose to \u226410 mg/day prior to leukapheresis.\n* Previous treatment with any gene or adoptive cell therapy products.\n* Any serious, uncontrolled diseases (including, but not limit to, unstable angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmia, HIV, seizure disorder, cerebrovascular disease, psychiatric disease), that may interfere with the patient's ability to tolerate the therapy or comply with assessments.\n* Active malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g. cervix, bladder, breast). Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial (e.g. Low Gleason score prostate Cancer).",

                    "briefSummary": "Non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCBP) is considered the leading cause of impairment of normal, symptom-free life (disability-adjusted life years - DALYs). NSCBP force more people out of work than diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, respiratory disease, asthma and cancer together. Strength and stability-oriented training programs in particular can lead to a significant improvement in NSCBP. However, back pain patients often cite time limitations and kinesiophobia (fear of movements) as the main reasons for their physical inactivity . The time-effective, joint-friendly and highly customizable whole-body electromyostimulation technology (WB-EMS) has been shown to be an effective alternative to conventional back training in two recently published clinical studies Following the successful implementation of this concept, dissemination of the positive results and testing of suitable settings for its implementation, the next step is to adapt and implement the concept as part of a knowledge transfer project in outpatient rehabilitation settings. The present project thus aimed to compare the effect of WB-EMS versus medical therapeutic therapy (MTT) using dedicated resistances devices as a recognized safe and effective treatment for low back pain."

Giving LCT, such as surgery and/or radiation, after initial treatment may kill any remaining tumor cells. Brigatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving LCT and brigatinib may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of brigatinib with local consolidative therapy (LCT) in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive ALK-rearranged advanced (non-small cell lung cancer) NSCLC.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in advanced ALK+ NSCLC patients treated with local consolidative therapy (LCT) after achieving stable disease or partial response with first-line brigatinib treatment.\n\nII. To determine overall survival (OS).\n\nIII. To assess time to progression (TTP) of non-LCT lesions.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess time to appearance of new metastatic lesion(s).\n\nII. To determine the utility of pre-treatment, pre-LCT, and post-LCT circulating free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) as a potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.\n\nII. To evaluate potential impact of LCT on mechanisms of ALK resistance with molecular analysis of post-progression biopsies.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive brigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo LCT for up to 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 7 days after completion of LCT, patients receive brigatinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months for up to 2 years."

The following three types of escalations were reported: treatment termination, treatment step-up/switch and treatment step-down. Treatment termination was defined as the termination of a DMARD (or multiple when on combination therapy) without starting a new DMARD therapy. Treatment step-up/switch was defined as an increase from the current treatment regime towards e.g.a combination of DMARDs and treatment step-down, was defined as de-escalation from the current treatment regime, example (e.g.) from combination therapy to monotherapy.

The following three types of escalations were reported: treatment termination, treatment step-up/switch and treatment step-down. Treatment termination was defined as the termination of a DMARD (or multiple when on combination therapy) without starting a new DMARD therapy. Treatment step-up/switch was defined as an increase from the current treatment regime (monotherapy) towards a combination of DMARDs and treatment step-down, was defined as de-escalation from the current treatment regime, e.g. from combination therapy to monotherapy. Number of participants with total number of each type of treatment escalations during the study (step-up/switch, step-down, treatment termination along with all escalations) are reported in this outcome measure.",

The FFbH questionnaire consisted of 18 questions with 3 possible responses (Yes; Yes, but with effort; No or only with outside help). The total score was the sum of the scores of all 18 questions, where for each question (Yes = 2 points; Yes, but with effort = 1 point; No or only with outside help = 0 points).The functional capacity (%) is calculated by (total score\\*100) divided by (2\\*number of valid responses). The change from baseline was calculated at each time point as functional capacity at timepoint - functional capacity at baseline.",

The FFbH questionnaire consisted of 18 questions with 3 possible responses (Yes; Yes, but with effort; No or only with outside help). The total score was the sum of the scores of all 18 questions, where for each question (Yes = 2 points; Yes, but with effort = 1 point; No or only with outside help = 0 points). The functional capacity \\[%\\] is calculated by (total score\\*100)/ (2\\*number of valid responses). Functional remission in FFbH was defined as functional capacity \\> 83 %.",

Histologically proven, advanced high-grade osteosarcoma not suitable for local treatments with curative intent\n4. Confirmed disease progression by radiological report to at least one line of standard chemotherapy containing cisplatin and anthracycline, and no more than 2 previous lines.\n5. Measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 criteria and documented by CT/MRI (Appendix 1 - RECIST Response Criteria). NOTE: Lesions to be used as measurable disease for the purpose of response assessment must either:\n\n   1. not reside in a field that has been subjected to prior radiotherapy, or\n   2. have demonstrated clear evidence of radiographic progression since the completion of prior radiotherapy and prior to study enrolment.\n6. Provision of a newly obtained tumour biopsy (either from the primary tumour or from metastases) during screening and on-treatment from all patients \\>16 years of age. Notes:\n\n   * The identified lesion to be biopsied should not have been previously irradiated and should not be the only lesion being used as a measurable-disease target lesion for objective response assessment. Patients must have tumour lesions that can be accessible for biopsy with acceptable clinical risk in the judgement of the Investigator.\n   * In case a patient has had a tumour biopsy in the previous 6 months and a paraffin block is available, a new biopsy does not need to be done at Screening (if they have received no treatment after biopsy).\n7. Documented progression on or following the last line of therapy.\n8. ECOG performance status 0-2 (Appendix 2 - Performance Status Criteria).\n9. Life expectancy of \u2265 12 weeks as estimated by the treating physician.\n10. Resolution of all acute, reversible toxic effects of prior therapy or surgical procedure to Grade \u22641 (except alopecia and peripheral neuropathy to Grade \u22642).\n11. Adequate organ function.\n12. If not postmenopausal or surgically sterile, female patients and female sexual partners of male patients must be willing to use at least one highly effective method of birth control (hormonal contraception, IUD, abstinence, condom) for at least a menstrual cycle before and for 3 months after last study drug administration.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Treatment with systemic anti-cancer therapy within three weeks prior to study drug administration for chemotherapy and 5 half-lives for targeted therapies.\n2. Radiation therapy within four weeks prior to study entry. Localised palliative radiotherapy to nontarget lesions is allowed\n3. Low-grade osteosarcoma, parosteal, or periosteal osteosarcoma.\n4. Prior history of other malignancies other than osteosarcoma (except for basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) unless the patient has been free of the disease for at least 2 years.\n5. Non-malignant systemic disease including cerebrovascular accident, unstable angina pectoris, unstable atrial fibrillation, unstable cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the last six months, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (Appendix 5 - New York Heart Association Criteria).\n6. Patients with active uncontrolled infection or known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (except after vaccination) or hepatitis C infection. Investigators may test as per their discretion.\n7. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n8. Patients with symptomatic or unstable central nervous system primary tumour or metastases and/or sarcomatous meningitis\n9. Live vaccine in the last four weeks.\n10. Current participation in another interventional therapeutic trial.\n11. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study.\n12. Knowledge of any other disease or medication that may interfere with study treatment.\n13. Patients with known allergies or hypersensitivity reactions to the active substance or to any of its excipients\n14. Patient unable to comply with the study protocol owing to psychological, social (lack of social support or social exclusion) or geographical reasons.",

                    "detailedDescription": "Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a bacteria that cause a number of different infections that range from mild illnesses to deadly diseases. It is estimated 500,000 deaths occur worldwide each year from GAS. To address these high rates of disease, the investigators want to test a new potential vaccine for safety and immune response in healthy participants.\n\nThe investigators will verify the immediate safety of the J8-K4S2 and p\\*17-K4S2 vaccines using a test dose in 10 volunteers. With respect to J8-K4S2 vaccine, safety of one of the peptide components (J8) has previously been established. Therefore, The investigators will begin with a test dose of J8-K4S2. The first IM injection of J8-K4S2 will be administered to the first participant. The investigators will wait two days, assess safety, then administer J8-K4S2 to a second participant. The investigators will wait two days, assess safety, then administer J8-K4S2 to a third participant. This process will continue until 5 participants have received a test dose of J8- K4S2. If there are no safety concerns with the first 5 participants, the investigators will have shown the preliminary safety of the K4S2 component. If the J8-K4S2 vaccine is well-tolerated, second and third doses of J8-K4S2 will be administered at 3 and 6 weeks, testing the safety of repeated dosing.\n\nThe investigators will next administer p\\*17-K4S2 to a sixth participant, wait two days, assess safety, and administer p\\*17-K4S2 to a seventh participant. The investigators will wait two days, assess safety, then administer p\\*17-K4S2 to an eighth participant. This process will continue until 5 participants have received a test dose of p\\*17-K4S2. If there are no safety concerns, the investigators will have shown the preliminary safety of the p\\*17 component. If the p\\*17-K4S2 peptide vaccine is well-tolerated, second and third doses of p\\*17-K4S2 will be administered at 3 and 6 weeks, testing the safety of repeated dosing.\n\nFollowing this stage 1 challenge, if no safety concerns arise, the study will proceed to stage 2, with randomized allocation to each arm for 20 more participants who will receive J8-K4S2 vaccine (n=5), p\\*17-K4S2 vaccine (n=5), and 10 who receive comparator (rabies) vaccine."
