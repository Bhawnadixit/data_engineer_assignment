All participants will be trained on office ergonomics and proper sitting posture at the beginning of the study. Group 1: Exercise and Postural feedback, Group 2: Exercise. Sociodemographic information will be questioned, pain, neck proprioception, craniovertebral angle, neck muscle strength, endurance and range of motion will be assessed. Neck disability index, physical activity level, stress perception level, fatigue level, work performance and patient satisfaction will also be evaluated at baseline and 8 weeks.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Treatment of work-related musculoskeletal disorders can be challenging due to multiple underlying risk factors like physical workload, poor posture, altered sensorimotor control, biopsychosocial conditions. When the information provided by the individual's own sensory system is insufficient, the use of extrinsic feedback has been proposed as an option to reduce sensorimotor discomfort and thus improve movement control. Due to the progress in miniaturization technology of the microelectromechanical system, postural feedback devices have been developed.\n\nRecent studies have used different feedback methods to improve posture. Studies have compared the effectiveness of different types of feedback, active exercise and passive therapy. However, there is a need for studies examining the effects of adding postural feedback to different intervention strategies in the office environment.\n\nSmall, lightweight and easy to wear feedback devices can be expected to provide positive effects on neck pain and proprioception in addition to classical exercises by providing real-time feedback to the user during daily activities."

                    "briefSummary": "Fibrotic interstitial lungs diseases (ILD) are a group of chronic and rare diseases characterized by an altered blood oxygenation in the lung, leading to dyspnea and physical limitation. Physical training is efficient to fight vicious circle of physical deconditioning observed in ILD. Eccentric cycling is an interesting modality of endurance training, allowing better exercise tolerance and adherence while developing cardiorespiratory function. Feasibility and efficacity of eccentric cycling were shown in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but never in ILD. The primary aim of our work is to compare concentric and eccentric cycling training on physical capacities in ILD. Moreover, we will study the effects of training on the different steps of oxygen transport at exercise, from the lung to the muscles through the blood transport. Our second goal is then to characterize the physiological mechanisms underlying the benefits of exercising in ILD patients. Evaluations will be led during one year to study the long-term effects of training",
                    "detailedDescription": "60 patients with fibrosing interstitial lung disease will be included in this study. Initial assessments at the beginning will be conducted for an overview of initials abilities and divided in 3 sessions. The first session (day 1) patients will be tested on maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing with different devices to evaluate oxygen transport, and on different functional tests like 6minute walk test, sit to stand test, .. The second session (day 6) is composed by respiratory tests like spirometry, plethysmography and diffusing capacity of nitric oxyde and carbon monoxyde at rest and exercise. The last session, one week after the first (day 9), patients will performed a maximal cardiopulmonary treadmill testing, strength testing and physical activity questionnaire. Between day 1 and day 9, patients will be asked to wear an accelerometer to quantify daily physical activity and completed quality of life questionnaire. Then, patients will be randomised in control group (concentric cycling) and experimental group (eccentric cycling). They will be trained 3 times/week during 12 weeks at the same intensity, verified by gas exchange analysis (50 \u00e0 70% VO2reserve). The training is composed of aerobic training (eccentric or concentric cycling according to randomisation), muscle training and adapted sports. All assessments of the beginning will be also conducted after 12 weeks of training (3 months after inclusion) to study impact of training and between groups to compare the two cycling modalities in this population. To allow a follow-up after training, all assessments will be conducted 6 and 12 months after the inclusion."

                    "briefSummary": "This study investigates the benefits of using telehealth services, specifically a combination of music therapy and social work support, to improve the well-being of older adults. Investigators are focusing on outcomes such as reduced loneliness, improved cognition, and how well older adults with and without dementia perceive the quality of the services received. This research is crucial because as the population ages and conditions like Alzheimer's become more prevalent, effective psychosocial interventions are needed.\n\nThe collaborative telehealth approach of the intervention in this study strives to connect older adults to community and health-related services. Older adults experience challenges in accessing services related to transportation, social support, and finances. While the pandemic prompted a rapid shift of healthcare services online, including music therapy and social work, questions remain about the quality of this transition, especially for older adults who may not be familiar with or have the resources for telehealth.\n\nIn this pilot study, investigators are studying music therapy and social work support through telehealth to understand how this approach can impact the well-being, cognition, and service quality for older adults, both with and without dementia. Social workers, who focus on improving well-being and addressing various needs, can leverage the therapeutic relationship built by music therapists to better identify and meet service needs. This pilot study builds on a feasibility project, which indicated that this collaborative framework is acceptable, valuable, and of interest to older adults, facilitating remote community connection. Through this research, investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness of telehealth services for older adults to inform a future larger trial.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The goal of this quantitative pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative music therapy and social work telehealth framework for community-dwelling older adults with and without dementia with regards to their emotions, well-being, cognition, and perceived service quality. This pilot study builds on a feasibility study that field tested logistics and provided proof-of-concept of the novel telehealth framework. Specifically, the feasibility study evaluated the acceptability, barriers, and facilitators of this framework for older adults with and without dementia. Both music-based interventions were grounded in the person-centered Clinical Practice Model for Persons with Dementia, which provides guidelines for adjusting the degree of support and challenge offered to an individual. The investigators developed a collaborative social work referral worksheet. The investigators conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with participants and care partners, who offered input about all aspects of the study. The investigators also refined recruitment, data collection, protocol training, and intervention processes. This pilot study builds on this past feasibility work.\n\nOlder adults often experience changes in health, finances, and social support which impede community involvement. Social distancing surrounding COVID-19 exacerbated such hurdles and enhanced risk for loneliness, depression, and cognitive decline. Although many services including music therapy and social work transitioned from in-person to telehealth during the pandemic, the rapid shift suggests that innovation occurred reactively, without sufficient time to evaluate the quality or effectiveness of this service delivery model. Telehealth is likely to continue to be a component of the music therapy profession and more broadly in healthcare. With thoughtful and systematic development to bridge the digital divide, telehealth may offer some benefit to community-dwelling older adults. This goal may be accomplished through interprofessional collaboration. Music therapists can address psychosocial needs through a variety of flexible and age-appropriate music experiences, while social workers have expertise to reach isolated individuals and connect them to appropriate supports. This pilot study advances a line of research to test a novel telehealth framework that integrates social work and music therapy to promote older adult well-being.\n\nIn this quantitative pilot study, the investigators will test methods and procedures that will be used in a future larger clinical trial to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of this research. The objectives of this pilot study are to examine the effects of the collaborative telehealth framework on older adults' well-being (primary aim), cognition, loneliness, perception of service quality, and (in response to music therapy) emotions, and to gather preliminary data for effect size estimation. Participants and interventionists will be invited to engage in a semi-structured qualitative interview at the conclusion of the study to inform further optimization of the collaborative telehealth framework. Participants have the option to use their own or borrow equipment (iPads). To reach those with limited resources, there will be 2 iPads with cellular data available to ship to enable study participation. Participants will be community-dwelling older adults with and without dementia. All participants will receive music therapy via telehealth and social work wellness sessions via telehealth. Collaboration is the key difference in the levels of independent variable: participants will be randomly assigned to either a collaborative condition, or non-collaborative condition. In the collaborative condition, information collected during music therapy will inform social work wellness sessions following a protocol developed during the feasibility study. In the non-collaborative condition, social workers and music therapists will operate telehealth services independently."

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot randomized clinical trial is to learn if a music therapy treatment, called AMUSED, can improve engagement and reduce behavioral symptoms in older adults with severe dementia who live in care facilities. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is it feasible to conduct a full-scale trial of AMUSED?\n* Can investigators identify the best outcome measures to assess impact on behavioral symptoms of dementia?\n* Does speech offer a useful indicator of treatment effectiveness? Researchers will compare a group-based music therapy treatment to a reading activity to learn if music therapy leads to greater improvements in behavioral symptoms and speech patterns.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Participate in either music therapy (includes live music, singing, and rhythmic instrument playing) or a reading group with stories about life and nature and talk about memories.\n* Attend small group sessions twice a week for 12 weeks, with each session lasting 40 minutes between lunch and dinner.\n* Be observed and assessed for behavioral symptoms, cognition, and speech several times during treatment and at a 4-week follow-up.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Meaningful activity has personal importance or usefulness, fosters a sense of fulfillment, and contributes to well-being, whether through cherished pastimes or goal-oriented endeavors. Persons with dementia (PWD) experience significant deficits in memory, communication, and functional abilities, which poses unique obstacles to engage in meaningful activities. When PWD lack sufficient activity, or if activities are poorly tailored to ability, PWD can demonstrate increased behavioral symptoms. Such symptoms impact the PWD and contribute to caregiver stress. Nonetheless, PWD across the severity continuum often respond favorably to music. Thoughtfully designed music-based interventions (MBIs) may offer PWD opportunities to engage in meaningful activity and socialize. However, empirical evidence to support the use of MBIs with this population is very limited. This pilot study advances a line of research to test and refine a randomized clinical trial design and gather preliminary data on intervention effectiveness beyond a single session.\n\nThe overall objectives of this quantitative pilot study are to (i) establish a well-refined clinical trial design, procedures, and outcome measures and (ii) obtain preliminary data of enduring effectiveness of a multimodal music therapy intervention for engaging persons with severe dementia (AMUSED) with regards to behavioral symptoms and speech. AMUSED uses live participant-preferred music and progressively layers singing, touch, and rhythmic instrument playing concurrent with participant behavioral responses. This MBI is grounded in the person-centered Clinical Practice Model for PWD, which provides guidelines for adjusting the degree of support and challenge offered to an individual. This Model is also used to enhance treatment fidelity.\n\nThis pilot study builds on a feasibility study that field tested logistics and demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the AMUSED intervention protocol through a randomized cross-over trial design. The researchers refined recruitment, data collection, protocol training, and intervention processes. As in past similar work, the researchers demonstrated positive engagement during music therapy sessions. However, obtaining longer-term measures of treatment effects (i.e., neuropsychiatric inventory, Fitbit actigraphy, pulse oximetry, functional measures) proved impractical and unreliable in the care milieu. The researchers' recent qualitative work with long-term care staff revealed possible solutions to more feasibly measure such outcomes in a long-term care setting. The current pilot study builds on this past feasibility and qualitative work.\n\nIn this quantitative pilot study, the investigators will use a randomized clinical trial design to test methods and procedures that will be used in a future larger clinical trial. This will help enhance the rigor and reproducibility of this research. The aims of this pilot study are to: 1) determine whether the clinical trial protocol is feasible for a full-scale trial, 2) select the most appropriate primary outcome measure(s) of behavioral symptoms of dementia, and 3) determine if spontaneous speech offers a useful indicator of music-based intervention effectiveness in persons with severe dementia. Participants will be older adults with severe dementia who live in a long-term care facility. To isolate the effects of the music and obtain an estimate of cluster effects, care facilities will be randomly assigned to either receive music therapy or reading. Both conditions use the same structure, strategies, and dosage, with music being the key difference."

The experiment will involve three study visits.\n\nIn the first study visit, participants will complete an online grocery store shopping task without intervention. Participants will be given a budget of $50 and asked to shop as they normally would. The store will record participants' selections. After completing the shopping task, participants will complete an online survey.\n\nApproximately one week later, participants will complete a second study visit with the same instructions. They will be randomized to 1 of 4 conditions (1) health only, 2) environment only, 3) combined health and environment, 4) control. In the health only condition, participants will view labels with health grades and may be directed to swap their selections for healthier items. In the environment only condition, participants will view labels with climate impact grades and may be directed to swap their selections for more sustainable items. In the health and environment condition, participants will view labels with health and climate impact grades and may be directed to swap their selections for healthier or more sustainable items. In the control group, participants will not view any labels or swaps. The store will record participants' selections. After completing the shopping task, participants will complete an online survey.\n\nIn the third study visit, the participants will maintain their assigned group and will be asked to repeat the same tasks as in the second visit."

The research is a quasi-experimental research with experimental-control groups. Students will be divided into experimental and control groups with the \"simple randomization\" method. A pre-test will be taken with data collection tools before the study for both groups. Students in the control group will continue their routine practice experiences. A post-test will be applied with data collection tools at the end of the 8-week internship period. TouchPoint is planned as a 2-session experience over a semester: Session 1 focuses on patient-centered care, Session 2 focuses on teamwork and collaboration. The method of both sessions will be conducted by 2 researchers with a small clinical group of 8 to 10 students. Sessions will last from 1.5 hours to 2 hours depending on the number of students and the degree of discussion. Sessions will be conducted face-to-face in a classroom.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Outcome Measures:\n\nClinical Learning Climate Scale: This measurement tool used in the study was developed by Demiral Y\u0131lmaz (2010). This scale consists of 36 items (Demir Y\u0131lmaz, 2010). The scale is scored using a 5-point Likert scale (I completely disagree: 1 - I completely agree: 5). Three dimensions are defined in the factor analysis of the scale. These dimensions are; clinical environment, emotional climate and motivation.\n\nStudent Satisfaction Scale-Short Form: SSS-SF is the shortened and revised version of the \"Student Satisfaction Scale\" developed by Baykal et al. to determine the satisfaction of students studying at nursing schools, by Baykal et al. in 2011. In the evaluation of the 53 items in the scale, a five-point Likert-type measurement is used, including \"5-Strongly agree, 4- Agree, 3-Undecided, 2-Disagree, 1-Strongly disagree\". As the average score approaches 1 in the scale as a whole and in the sub-dimensions, the student is considered to be dissatisfied, and as the score approaches 5, the student is considered to be satisfied. The scale was found to be highly reliable, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.97 in total. The scale has 5 sub-dimensions, namely, faculty members, school administration, participation in decisions, scientific, social and technical opportunities, and quality of education. The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 265 and the lowest score is 53. As the average score on the scale as a whole and in the sub-dimensions approaches 1, the student is considered to be insatiable, and as the score approaches 5, the student is considered to be satisfied.\n\nEligibility Criteria: Being a 2nd year student at the Faculty of Nursing, Agreeing to participate in the research"

                    "briefSummary": "Veterans with mental illness face challenges with community reintegration, including achieving vocational success, attaining their educational goals and going back to school, and maintaining a high quality of life. VA Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs, Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers and other mental health treatment programs are designed to help Veterans overcome these barriers, but cognitive impairment often seen in Veterans with mental illness limits gains from these settings. Cognitive remediation interventions can be helpful, but they are either \"one-size fits all,\" and thus may not be useful for all Veterans with mental illness, or are too narrow in scope, focusing on specific mental illnesses, limiting generalizability.\n\nThis project will test whether an objective neurophysiological biomarker, mismatch negativity (MMN), can better match the \"right\" Veteran to the \"right\" cognitive remediation treatment regardless of their specific mental health diagnosis.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is an observational, non-interventional study. Veterans with mental health diagnoses currently engaged in, or within 6 weeks of discharge from VA Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (RRTP), Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers (PRRC), and other mental health treatment settings (inpatient or outpatient mental healthcare) will be recruited. Veterans will have their cognitive functioning assessed. Following this, mismatch negativity (MMN) will be assessed via electroencephalography (EEG). Participants will undergo a 1 hour computerized cognitive training program. They will be interviewed about their attitudes about EEG and computerized cognitive training. They will be followed monthly for a total of 4 months from study entry to assess recovery trajectory. This study aims to enroll 104 Veterans from the VA San Diego Healthcare System.\n\nThe Specific Aims of this proposal are 1) Determine whether MMN is related to functioning, psychosocial recovery in VA rehabilitation milieus and programs; 2) Determine whether MMN is linked to cognition and predicts cognitive remediation exercise performance in a heterogeneous group of Veterans with mental illness. The proposal will also assess feasibility and acceptability of using biomarker-guided cognitive rehabilitation interventions in VA mental health rehabilitation settings.\n\nInformation gained from this study will help establish a precision-medicine approach towards cognitive rehabilitation for Veterans with mental illness."

The four classes are described below:\n\nClass I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or shortness of breath.\n\nClass II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, shortness of breath or chest pain.\n\nClass III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, shortness of breath or chest pain.\n\nClass IV: Symptoms of heart failure at rest. Any physical activity causes further discomfort.\n\nSubjects' NYHA Classification based on above criteria was assessed during follow up, and subjects were assigned to one of four classifications. Results are presented as percentage of all available subjects who were assigned each functional class (I-IV).",

The study will be performed in two stages. During Stage 1, participants will be randomized to fulvestrant (control) or an atezolizumab-containing doublet or triplet combination. Those who experience disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity may be eligible to receive a new triplet combination treatment in Stage 2 until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. New treatment arms may be added and/or existing treatment arms may be closed during the course of the study on the basis of ongoing clinical efficacy and safety as well as the current treatments available."
