The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate if utilizing nixtamalized biofortified maize has the potential to increase dietary Zn and Fe intake and improve the amount of Zn and Fe absorbed when compared to diets incorporating traditional maize (control). This is a randomized, double blinded, comparison study of biofortified vs control maize prepared as tortillas from nixtamalized masa. This study will enroll up to 56 school aged children (10-14 yrs old) living in agricultural communities in the Western Highlands of Guatemala (28/group x 2 groups). Researchers will utilize Zn and Fe stable isotopes to measure total absorbed Zn and Fe. Participants will be active in the study for 27 days. During this time, they will have anthropometric measurements taken and collect 2 blood samples, 1 stool sample, and 9 urine samples."

Safety and tolerability of multiple day dosing of pacritinib in the subject populations will also be evaluated.",

A total of approximately 22 to 32 subjects are planned, with approximately 8 moderate hepatically impaired subjects, approximately 6 to 8 severe hepatically impaired subjects, and approximately 8 to 16 healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. The primary objective of this study is to characterize and compare the steady-state PK profile of multiple doses (14 days) of 200 mg BID pacritinib in the study population, and the secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses (14 days) of 200 mg BID pacritinib. The study will consist of a screening period (Day -28 to Day -2), check-in (Day -1), a confinement period including treatment period (Day 1 through Day 14) and post-treatment period (Day 15 through Day 20), followed by a discharge visit (Day 21), and an EOS follow-up telephone call (Day 44). Serial blood samples for PK analysis of pacritinib will be collected pre dose through Day 21 at protocol-specified timepoints CK 18 will be collected . Safety and tolerability will be assessed by AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital will occur 4 and 24 hours after the AM dose on Day 1, Day 10, Day 12, and Day 14 signs, ECGs, and physical examinations."

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to test the topical drug clascoterone in patients with pilonidal disease, which is a common, benign skin condition of the gluteal cleft. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does clascoterone improve the severity of pilonidal disease as scored by a physician?\n* Does clascoterone improve patient symptoms due to pilonidal disease?\n* Does clascoterone improve the inflammation seen under the microscope in pilonidal disease removed at surgery Participants will apply clascoterone or a placebo cream to the diseased area for 3 months. They will be assessed every 4 weeks for disease severity assessed by a physician viewing patient photos and a symptom-based survey.\n\nResearchers will compare participants who received clascoterone treatment to those who received placebo.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. Recruitment The investigators will recruit patients from the University of Pennsylvania colorectal surgery clinics which consist of six high-volume surgeons and five advance practice providers across three hospitals serving a major metropolitan area. Patients considered for elective surgery will be recruited for the study and undergo a thorough informed consent process. Patients with asymptomatic disease and those with acute abscesses will be excluded as will patients who are pregnant or concurrently on a systemic anti-androgen (i.e. spironolactone). At the intake visit, patients will undergo a 1:1 randomization performed by the University of Pennsylvania's Investigational Drug Service (IDS). Recruited subjects will receive clascoterone or a vehicle cream matched for consistency, color, and container so that both subject and investigator are blinded to the assignment. At the intake visit, subjects will be advised to apply cream to cover the affected area twice daily for 12 weeks. At the intake visit, baseline disease assessment will be obtained including demographics, height and weight, medication usage, and personal history of PSD such as disease onset and prior procedures. Baseline disease measurements and medical photography will be obtained. Photographs will be taken with a dedicated camera, patients given a codified study ID, and data entered into a deidentified, HIPAA- compliant database.\n\nI. Objective assessment of Disease Severity: Medical photography and analysis To objectively evaluate PSD, the investigators will obtain physical measurements of disease extent (left to right, cranial to caudal) and obtain disease photographs at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12. Photographs will be collected, deidentified, and provided to two colorectal surgeons for scoring. Surgeons will be asked to compare each timepoint to baseline and rate the PSD severity as significantly worsened, mildly worsened, unchanged, mildly improved, or significantly improved. Discrepant evaluations between surgeons will be referred to a third blinded surgeon.\n\nII. Assessment of Dermatology Quality of Life Randomized subjects will be administered the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The DLQI is a 10-question survey scored from 0-30 that has been applied widely across multiple dermatologic conditions and covers a range of potential quality of life impacts over a weekly basis. Specifically, the DLQI inquires about the impact of skin disease on symptoms (\"Over the past week, how itchy, painful, or stinging has your skin been?\"), daily activities, leisure, work and school, and personal relationships, as well as a question of impact of treatment (\"Over the last week, how much of a problem has the treatment of your skin been?\"). Subjects respond Very much, A lot, A little, or Not at all for descending scores of 3 to zero. A score at or above 10 is considered a significant impact on quality of life. Responses to the individual questions will be summed and responses compared between groups after unblinding at data analysis.\n\nIII. The investigators anticipate that a large portion of subjects in both groups will ultimately undergo surgery. Those that undergo surgery within 4 weeks will be selected for these analyses, on the hypothesis that the effect of clascoterone may subside at a longer interval. At surgery, blinded investigators will measure the left-right, cranial-caudal, and superficial-deep measurements of the excisional defect with a sterile ruler. The investigators will then follow patients with chart review in the electronic medical record for 8 weeks postoperatively to assess for immediate wound complications such as cellulitis, wound separation, abscess, and early recurrence.\n\nIII. Assessment of Cutaneous Inflammation A full thickness representative sample of the excised pilonidal cyst and adjacent normal tissue will be obtained at operation, fixed in formalin and delivered to the skin phenomics core of the University of Pennsylvania Skin Biology Disease Research Core (SBDRC). Following de-paraffination, rehydration, antigen retrieval, and blocking as necessary, SBDRC-validated antibodies will be applied to characterize the inflammatory infiltrate, specifically anti- CD3 (T- cells and Natural Killer Cells), anti-CD4 (helper T-cells), anti-CD8 (cytotoxic T-cells), anti-CD68 (macrophages), anti-CD79 (B cells). Investigators blinded to treatment groups will assess the specimens for epidermal, dermal, and subcuticular inflammatory infiltrates, hyperkeratosis, and follicular hyperplasia. Antibody-positive cells will be counted in six randomly selected fields under a light microscope at 400x magnification. Cell counts will be tallied and means and standard deviations compared between groups."

                    "briefSummary": "In this study, we will randomly assign 360 older adults to 12 months of 5 minutes per day of functional resistance training or to a delayed treatment control condition, and measure the impact of the training on measures of lower extremity performance and walking ability.",
                    "detailedDescription": "One of the most common, and untreated, health problems among older adults is mobility disability, observed in nearly one in five (17.9%) of older adults. Mobility disability is typically the first disability to develop and increases future risk for additional disabilities and death. Though the most effective treatments for mobility disability are forms of exercise, especially resistance training (RT), they are rarely used, with fewer than 20% of older adults meeting RT guidelines and even fewer among those with mobility disability. The core problem of disseminating the benefits of RT to older adults is adherence. One potential opportunity to enhance adherence to RT, which has not been tested, is to make RT programs shorter. Studies show that most of the benefits of RT accrue with the first few sets per week, consistent with the law of diminishing utility. While traditional RT programs for older adults, like those offered by Silver Sneakers, are typically 45 minutes three times weekly, fewer than 5% of older adults with free access to these programs participate. Our qualitative work shows that older adults often feel that 45 minute sessions are too challenging (e.g., \"I don't think I have the strength to do it for 45 minutes\") and 75% of older adults we surveyed preferred a 5 minute RT to a 45 minute RT option, assuming they were equally effective. In 2020, we set out to design a brief, home-based RT program that would lead to both high levels of adherence and functional improvement. We called the program FAST (Functional Activity Strength Training) and, to overcome its brevity, FAST was augmented with several standard behavior change techniques (e.g., feedback, reminders, self-monitoring) and a novel form of goal- setting, rarely used in RT studies, for the number of additional repetitions participants should be able to do during the study. In FAST-1, 24 healthy older adults were prescribed 30 seconds of squats and push-ups each day and given no personal supervision. Over 6 months, they performed the exercises on 73% of days and showed large increases in squat and push-up performance (Cohen's d \\> 1.0). In FAST-2, we randomly assigned 97 older adults with mobility disability, and those assigned to 30 seconds each of chair stands and steps onto a stepper each day completed exercises on 81% of days (5.7 days per week) and improved their 5 time sit-to-stand test (-2.8 seconds, Cohen's d=0.53), 30 second chair stand test (+4.2 repetitions, d=1.1) and One Leg Stand test (+3.7 seconds, d=0.40), versus controls. In this multicenter study, we will randomly assign 360 older adults with an SPPB score \\< 8 to 6 months of daily FAST or to a delayed control group. We will test the impact of FAST on physical performance, walking ability, falls and functional limitations. We hypothesize that FAST will improve these measures more than controls, and that those with greater adherence and perceived effort will improve the most. By rigorously testing FAST, we hope to change the paradigm of RT prescription from \"More is better\" to \"What will people do that works?\" and, if FAST proves superior, a future study will test whether FAST leads more older adults to do RT and, thereby, improve the public's health."

A number of improvements have been introduced to overcome the side effects and complications such as corneal haze, epithelial irregularities induced by wound healing, pain and delayed visual acuity recovery associated with PRK surgery. During traditional PRK, the corneal epithelium is mechanically debrided before stromal ablation is performed. Alcohol PRK is frequently used as an alternative to mechanical epithelial debridement and is considered simpler and faster. Transepithelial PRK (TransPRK) is a new method in which the corneal epithelium is photoablated by the laser in one step using a specific ablation profile.\n\nThis study attempts to establish a means of quantitatively and objectively measuring corneal haze, using patented software based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the cornea. This will confirm or refute the hypothesis of a lower occurrence of corneal haze after TransPRK (experimental group) versus PRK with alcohol (control group). Each patient will have one eye randomised to one of the two groups being compared."

However there is no evidence in the literature to support this approach. Because anaesthetic drugs and their side effects changed significantly from their first usage, the investigators can assume that existing approach is obsolete and has no place anymore in the modern medicine. Keeping patient n.p.o (nothing per os) for 2 hours after extubation may lead to patient\u00b4s thirst or other discomfort. The aim of the study is to detect whether early oral fluid intake after extubation could lead to safe relief of thirst and to better patient\u00b4s comfort overall.",

The objective of the present study was to explore the possible connection between the anti-apoptotic mechanisms associated with exercise and cognitive performance in a cohort of 60 older adults who participated in a 12-week supervised aerobic training regimen.\n\nA total of 120 healthy home residents and older subjects with an age range of 65 to 95 years were enrolled to participate in this study. Only, 60 subjects who met the inclusion criteria were included in this study.\n\nThe participants were categorized into two groups, specifically the control group (consisting of 30 individuals) and the exercise group (also comprising 30 individuals), based on their participation in an exercise program. Assessments of cognitive function, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), and apoptotic-related markers such as Bcl-2, p53, and Cytochrome c were conducted both before and after a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention."
