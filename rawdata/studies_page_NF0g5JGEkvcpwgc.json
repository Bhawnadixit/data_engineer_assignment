The patients will be 1:1 randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). Patients in IG will be intravenously administrated with sodium heparin (100U/Kg) at first medical contact, while patients in CG will be administrated with sodium heparin (100U/Kg) through catheter sheath in the CathLab.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nSTEMI patient; Symptom onset in 12 hours; Intended to perform PPCI.

Treatments for cancer can cause side effects such as fatigue as well as strain on relationships. Exercising Together is a partnered exercise program that adds communication, collaboration and support between partners during exercise to fortify the relationship and amplify the benefits of physical training. Exercising Together program may be effective on the mental and physical health of couples during radiation treatment for cancer.",

                    "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of azenosertib in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan in treating patients with HER2-positive and cyclin E amplified gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer and other HER2-positive solid tumors that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced), that have spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic), or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Azenosertib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It inhibits a protein called Wee1. Inhibition of the Wee1 protein can make tumor cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy drugs, leading to tumor cell death. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is composed of a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Giving azenosertib in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan may be safe, tolerable, and/or more effective in treating patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or unresectable HER2-positive gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or other solid tumors, compared to just trastuzumab deruxtecan alone.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd; DS-8201a) in combination with azenosertib (ZN-c3) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing/amplified solid tumors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe and record the antitumor activity of the T-DXd (DS-8201a) and azenosertib (ZN-c3) combination.\n\nII. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of T-DXd (DS-8201a) in combination with azenosertib (ZN-c3).\n\nIII. To assess predictors of response and acquired resistance to the T-DXd (DS-8201a) and azenosertib (ZN-c3) combination.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of azenosertib followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nDOSE ESCALATION: Patients receive T-DXd intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1 of each cycle and azenosertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) and collection of blood samples at screening and on study and undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial.\n\nDOSE EXPANSION: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT 1: Patients receive T-DXd IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 of each cycle and azenosertib PO QD on days 8-12 and 15-19 of cycle 1 and days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 in subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo ECHO or MUGA and collection of blood samples at screening and on study and undergo CT or MRI throughout the trial. Patients also undergo biopsy at screening and on study.\n\nCOHORT 2: Patients receive treatment as in the dose escalation arm. Patients also undergo ECHO or MUGA and collection of blood samples at screening and on study and undergo CT or MRI throughout the trial. Patients also undergo biopsy at screening and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months in years 1 and 2 and every 6 months in year 3."

                    "briefSummary": "Spine fractures are the most common fracture due to osteoporosis. They happen during falls or activities of daily life, like bending to tie shoes. Fractures of the spine can result in pain, which can sometimes last for a long time. Spine fractures can affect breathing, appetite, digestion, and mobility, and can restrict or modify people's work or daily activities. There are no standard rehabilitation programs after spine fracture, and patients often have to pay for rehabilitation. Rehabilitation can be hard to access, especially in rural or remote locations. It can be hard to find health care or rehabilitation providers who specialize in treating spine fractures. After reviewing research and consulting patients and health care providers to understand their experiences with spine fracture rehabilitation, the research team developed a toolkit for a virtual rehabilitation program for people with spine fractures, called VIVA.\n\nThe research team wants to submit a grant for a clinical trial to implement VIVA in five provinces and determine if VIVA reduces pain and improves physical functioning and quality of life, and if the benefits outweigh the costs. Before this, the team proposes to do a pilot study to test how feasible it is to do a study of VIVA in three provinces.",
                    "detailedDescription": "A multicenter trial will be conducted to investigate the feasibility of a future trial of VIVA in adults with spine fractures in Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec. As secondary outcomes, the research team will explore the effect of the intervention on physical function and balance, pain, fear of movement, falls, falls self-efficacy, quality of life, mood, nutrition risk, and physical activity. Adults over the age of 50 who have had at least one spine fracture in the past two years due to osteoporosis will be recruited. Participants will be randomized either to the immediate receipt of VIVA intervention; or delayed receipt of VIVA 10 weeks post-randomization. The VIVA intervention involves once weekly 1:1 rehabilitation sessions delivered by an exercise professional for eight weeks. The study will take place at the GERAS Centre (Ontario), Unity Health (Ontario), University of British Columbia (British Columbia), and McGill University Health Centre (Quebec). University of Waterloo will be the coordinating centre. The findings of this study will be used to decide if a larger clinical trial is feasible."

Additionally, for some patients with specific disease features, standard treatment may also include ablative treatment (radiation or surgery) of the prostate gland if this was not completed prior to enrolling into this study.\n\nAblative Therapy is a procedure used to destroy cancer cells and tissue. In this study Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) or surgery will be used to destroy prostate cancer metastases. It is not clear if ablative therapy (SBRT or surgery) to all sites of disease used in combination with standard systemic therapy can offer better results than standard treatment alone."

Participants will be followed for 12 months after the first immunization, so the duration of study participation will be 12 months after receipt of initial vaccination.\n\nApproximately 30 subjects will be enrolled in a rolling fashion to receive 2 doses of the B/HPIV3/S-6P vaccine intranasally 56 days apart. Participants who are enrolled and receive the first vaccine dose will not be replaced, even in the event they are ineligible or unable to take the second dose.\n\nUp to 60 subjects will be consented to ensure that 30 subjects are eligible for enrollment and vaccination. Volunteers will be enrolled in a staggered fashion:\n\nGroup 1: Up to 5 volunteers will be enrolled and vaccinated. Group 2: Up to 10 volunteers will be enrolled and vaccinated. Group 3: The remaining volunteers (up to 15) will be enrolled and vaccinated."

This pilot study will evaluate images obtained on the Halcyon 4.0 system to assess if the quality is sufficient for radiation treatment plan construction."

                    "briefSummary": "The investigators analyze the impact of exercise and ablation in patients with symptomatic short-persistent atrial fibrillation (Afib) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). It is hypothesized that the combination of ablation and exercise better improves peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) through improvement of peripheral (exercise training) and central (ablation) adaptations.\n\nExercise intervention will contain a 12-week combined, video-based, supervised, endurance, resistance and respiratory training.",
                    "detailedDescription": "In a feasibility study the investigators analyze the impact of exercise and ablation in patients with symptomatic short-persistent atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Patients will be randomized into 2 groups: (1) A control group receiving ablation therapy, and (2) a group receiving ablation therapy and a combination of endurance, strength and respiratory training. The investigators will include 20 patients/group. All patients will receive a smart watch to monitor heart rate and trigger ECG recordings during symptomatic episodes. Smart watch monitoring will be done for 4 weeks. Then all patients will receive baseline examination with laboratory markers, lung function testing, echocardiography, measurement of pulse wave velocity, and screening for sleep apnea. All patients will receive simultaneous cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and exercise right heart catheterization (exRHC) followed by ablation therapy. Patients will then be randomized into a training and control group. After 2 weeks all patients will receive outpatient CPET to assess changes of VO2peak compared to baseline.\n\nThe training group will receive home-based, video-supervised exercise training with a combination of endurance, strength and respiratory training (5x/week). The control group will receive standard recommendations on physical activity. Smart watch monitoring will be continued in all groups until the end of the study. After 12 weeks of training intervention, all groups will undergo echocardiography, lung function testing, measurement of pulse wave velocity and exRHC with simultaneous CPET. All patients will receive 24h Holter monitoring at the end of the study. During exRHC lactate kinetics will be analyzed and improvement of lactate thresholds through exercise training will be determined. The primary outcome is the improvement of VO2peak in the groups. Secondary outcomes are improvements in the ratio of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure/cardiac output (PAWP/CO) and mean pulmonary artery pressure/CO (mPAP/CO). Burden of atrial fibrillation in the groups will also be assessed. All groups will receive optimal drug therapy.\n\nThe investigators expect that a combined approach of ablation and exercise training will better improve VO2peak through central (ablation) and peripheral (exercise training) adaptations."
