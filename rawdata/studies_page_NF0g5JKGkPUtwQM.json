Adolescents will be recruited from middle schools and randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) psychoeducation, (b) psychoeducation + emotional skills enhancement, or (c) psychoeducation + emotional skills enhancement + positive childhood experience promotion. The school-based intervention will consist of 4-8 sessions, with assessments conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and a 3-month follow-up. Investigators will conduct multilevel models (MLMs) and structural equation models (SEMs) to investigate the impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs), alexithymia, and emotion regulation abilities on mental health outcomes in adolescents."

F4C focuses on reflective understanding of emotional experiences, how that impacts thoughts and behaviors related to SU, FV, co-parenting/parenting each session. Through greater self-awareness, the father is better able to apply coping, communication and parenting skills introduced to reduce SU and FV.",

                    "briefSummary": "International travel has increased dramatically in recent years. Vector-borne pathologies such as malaria and arboviruses are common etiologies of post-travel fever, which are prevalent in similar geographical areas (tropical and intertropical). Arboviruses, for \"arthropod-borne viruses,\" are transmitted by the bite of blood-sucking vectors (mosquitoes, ticks, or sandflies). The dengue, chikungunya, and zika viruses are transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus).\n\nThe establishment of Aedes albopictus (tiger mosquito), competent for transmitting these 3 viruses, since 2004 in mainland France and the transit of travelers carrying a virus allowed the appearance of the first autochthonous cases of dengue and zika. Each year, outbreaks of autochthonous cases of dengue fever are reported in the PACA, Occitanie, and Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne Alpes regions, and a cluster of 3 Indigenous cases was reported in 2023 in the Paris region.\n\nSince 2014, the tiger mosquito has been established in Bas-Rhin. Between 2014 and 2022, the vector was detected in around thirty municipalities around Strasbourg. In a department where the spread of the tiger mosquito is evolving rapidly, these data remind us that only an early diagnosis, delivered quickly, allows effective vector control measures to avoid generating autochthonous transmission.\n\nIn a previous study carried out at the Virology laboratory, we retrospectively analyzed the diagnosis of these 3 arboviruses after the exclusion of malaria in the context of recent travel over a period of 10 years (2014-2023). Among the 913 patients included, for 78% of cases (n=714), no testing for dengue, chikungunya, or zika was carried out, a proportion stable over 10 years.\n\nThese three arboviruses seem underdiagnosed, and we assume, given our previous results, that 8 to 10% of patients for whom, in the context of recent travel, a test for malaria comes back negative are imported cases of dengue, chikungunya, or zika. At the end of this retrospective study, we want to evaluate this sub-diagnosis on a larger sample to propose a review of practices and the establishment of Arbovirus-malaria \"reflex testing.\" Currently, no French or similar European data is available, allowing us to evaluate this under-diagnosis, which constitutes a significant risk of the emergence of indigenous clusters in our territory.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to determine the infection rate by dengue, chikungunya, and zika viruses identified when the diagnosis is made after the exclusion of negative malaria in the context of recent travel among patients treated at the Strasbourg University Hospitals between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2025.\n\nThe secondary objectives of this work are as follows:\n\nEstimate the prevalence of different clinical symptoms (patient medical records) in retrospectively identified cases of dengue, chikungunya, and zika.\n\n* Evaluate the onset time of symptoms in relation to the date of return/arrival from the area of stay of retrospectively identified cases of dengue, chikungunya, and zika.\n* Evaluate the delay in the appearance of symptoms in relation to the date of taking the initial sample (the one leading to the diagnosis of negative malaria) of retrospectively identified cases of dengue, chikungunya, and zika.\n* Study the laboratory results associated with the initial management of the patient (biochemical assessment and blood count) of retrospectively identified cases of dengue, chikungunya, and zika.\n* Study the distribution of areas, periods, and reasons for staying in retrospectively identified dengue, chikungunya, and zika cases.\n\nStudy the municipalities of residence of positive cases in the areas where the tiger mosquito is established."

                    "briefSummary": "This study will be the first of its kind to explore the impact of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) on arousal symptoms among patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The investigators will demonstrate that IPS cTBS results in significant reduction in arousal (measured by startle response) compared to sham cTBS, that IPS cTBS interacts with extinction training to further improve arousal, and that there is a dose/response effect of cTBS on arousal. The investigators will also demonstrate that IPS cTBS significantly improves retention of extinction learning, the experimental analogue of exposure therapy.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with alterations in arousal that do not respond well to evidence-based practices. Patients with PTSD tend to fall into one of two groups in extinction training (and in exposure therapy): 1) over-engagers, where arousal is too high; and 2) under-engagers, where patients are so worried about becoming upset that they distract themselves from the task (which prevents learning). In this mechanistic clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate a strategy to augment extinction training with neuromodulation to reduce arousal and improve extinction retention. Augmenting extinction training with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS, a type of transcranial magnetic stimulation) delivered to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) may lead to targeted reductions in arousal. The investigative team has shown that the IPS is a \"connectivity hub\" for arousal and that stimulating this region with TMS can reduce excessive arousal in healthy people. The goal for this R01 is to evaluate the main effects of IPS cTBS (versus sham cTBS, a between-subject comparison) and its interaction with extinction training (vs. neutral training) on arousal among patients with PTSD. The investigators hypothesize that reducing parietal hyperexcitability will help patients with PTSD to modulate arousal during extinction training-enough arousal to ensure that they can benefit, but not too much arousal which prevents learning. These results could translate into future opportunities for novel therapeutic targets among patients with PTSD. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1: To evaluate the optimal dose of IPS cTBS. H1: Attenuation of startle for IPS cTBS vs. sham cTBS will plateau at 1200 pulses, the anticipated optimal cumulative dose. Aim 2: To compare the main effect of IPS cTBS and its interaction with extinction training on arousal (measured by startle response). Using a two (between group: sham vs. IPS cTBS) x 2 (within group: extinction training vs. control/neutral training) randomized controlled design among patients with PTSD (N = 120), the investigators will examine the potential benefit of cTBS and extinction training on reduction in arousal. H2a: IPS cTBS will result in greater reduction in arousal compared to sham cTBS. H2b: Participants who receive IPS cTBS will have a significantly lower difference in retention of extinction learning vs. control/neutral training (indicative of greater retention of extinction learning) compared to participants who receive sham cTBS. Secondary: The investigators will test analogous hypotheses on subjective outcomes and on cognitive outcomes and the investigators hypothesize similar directions of effects. Aim 3: To evaluate neural mechanisms of action of IPS cTBS + extinction training. Participants will complete a resting state fMRI scan on tests of retention of learning experimental visits to evaluate neural changes from training. H3: The investigators will observe attenuated activation (relative to pre-test) of the IPS for participants who received IPS cTBS compared to those who received sham cTBS."

                    "briefSummary": "Total knee replacement surgery is a commonly performed and widely successful surgery to improve mobility and decrease pain in patients suffering from severe knee arthritis. However, in the immediate period after knee replacement, patients often experience significant pain and nausea, which can limit early recovery after surgery. Glucocorticoids are anti-inflammatory drugs that can reduce pain and swelling by blocking the inflammatory process, and have already shown promise in various surgical settings, including after knee replacement. There are different glucocorticoid formulations available, and in this particular study, we are evaluating the effects of administering a Medrol Dose Pak, which is a commonly available glucocorticoid taper that is administered over a short period of time after surgery. Our hypothesis is that the administration of the Medrol Dose Pak will lead to decreased pain, nausea, and opioid consumption in the weeks following total knee replacement.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a post-operative course of glucocorticoids on pain, range of motion, and extremity function after total knee replacement surgery. The goal is to compare the effects of a Medrol dose pak administration to the standard of care, which includes a single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone, on postoperative outcomes. The study is important in the field because it aims to evaluate the effectiveness of glucocorticoids in reducing pain, nausea, and opioid consumption following total knee replacement surgery. The study will provide valuable insight into the role and optimal dosing of oral glucocorticoids after total knee replacement surgery (TKA). The results of this study could potentially improve postoperative outcomes for patients undergoing TKA. The study population in this randomized control trial consists of patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: (1) a single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone (control group) or (2) a single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone followed by a 6-day oral methylprednisolone taper course. The study does not mention any populations of increased concern. The study will last approximately 6 months with encounters at normal times within the clinic. The Emory r extremity surgeons will personally contact all patients for 1-day post-operation (standard of care for them) and at 7-10 days. Recruitment will occur at Emory University Orthopaedics \\& Spine Hospital. The study team will enroll 100 patients per group - 200 total."

                    "briefSummary": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and dementia are both diseases with increasing incidence and prevalence globally, leading to substantial economic burdens for families and society. Notably, diabetes significantly increases the risk of cognitive dysfunction, which is classified into preclinical stage, mild cognitive impairment and dementia based on the disease severity. Cognitive dysfunction is a critical contributor to disability and mortality in elderly diabetes patients. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for delaying disease progression, enhancing treatment efficacy, and mitigating the impact of dementia. Currently, research and clinical management of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with diabetes are in their infancy, characterized by limitations such as single-center studies, limited sample sizes, inconsistent diagnostic criteria, and insufficient data sharing. Consequently, clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies are underdeveloped, medical staff's related knowledge is lacking, and potential therapeutic targets remain unexplored. In view of these problems and shortcomings, the population cohort study is supposed to be carried out based on accurate diagnosis and constructed the high standard information and sample bank. The study will establish the standard and quality system of T2D with cognitive dysfunction cohort study (unified standards and norms). The study will integrate the standard biological samples stratified acquisition function module (homogeneity and precision) of cognitive dysfunction in T2D, and complete the construction of biological samples bank and clinical diagnosis and treatment information database. The study will apply and develop brain structural and functional imaging technology to support precision diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction in T2D.",

The laboratory examinations, brain MRI and olfactory function measurements will be done in the screening period. The samples such as plasma, serum, urine and faeces et al. of the subjects will be collected in the study."

                    "briefSummary": "XLMTM (X-linked myotubular myopathy) is a serious genetic muscle condition. It is caused by changes in the MTM1 gene which stops or slows down normal muscle development, causing severe muscle weakness. There is currently no cure for XLMTM. Ongoing care is needed to manage symptoms and prevent further medical problems from this condition.\n\nRecent research shows that individuals with XLMTM often have reduced bile flow which can affect liver and gallbladder health. Bile is a liquid made in the liver that helps digest fat. Ongoing liver health checks may help with the routine care of people with XLMTM.\n\nThere is a need to understand liver problems that develop in individuals with XLMTM over time. The main aim of the study is to learn how many boys with XLMTM have new cases of liver problems during the study.\n\nThis study is about collecting information only. This is known as an observational study. The individual's doctor decides on treatment, not the study sponsor (Astellas).\n\nIn this study, boys under 18 diagnosed with XLMTM will be followed for about 1 year. The health of their liver and gallbladder will be checked about every 6 weeks. This can be done at home, if preferred. A scan called a Fibroscan (also known as transient elastography) will check for signs of scarring in the liver (fibrosis) and the build-up of lipids. It is suggested that each boy will have a Fibroscan when they start the study and another scan when they complete the study.\n\nThis study will help understand liver, gallbladder, and bile duct issues in individuals with XLMTM over time. The goal is to improve their care and provide information to use in future clinical studies."
