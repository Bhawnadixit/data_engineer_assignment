                    "briefSummary": "Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery is rapidly gaining popularity. Among the 5 femtosecond laser platforms available at present for cataract surgery, the Femto LDV Z8 (Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG) is a high-frequency system and delivers energy pulses in nanojoule levels, while Lensx platform (Lensx, Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) used a high-energy laser system. In femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery, the laser pretreatment is associated with breakdown of blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) associated with increased aqueous total prostaglandin, cytokines and Oxygen-free radicals concentration. The prostaglandin rise immediately after laser pretreatment is further thought to be the causative factor for the intraoperative miosis in femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery. However, the analysis of anterior chamber inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and pupil size after femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery between different laser platforms has not been investigated in clinical studies. Understanding the cytokine and chemokine changes related to the laser pretreatment provides better insight into the inflammatory response in femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery."

                    "briefSummary": "This study is comprised of three separate pharmacogenetic trials grouped into a single protocol due to similarities in the intervention, the hypotheses, and the trial design. The three trials are the Acute Pain Trial, the Chronic Pain Trial, and the Depression Trial. Participants can enroll in only one of the three trials. All three trials were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT04445792. In July 2023 each of the three treatment trials was registered under a separate NCT# and NCT04445792 was converted to a screening record per recent guidance on master protocol research programs (MPRPs). This record is specific to the Chronic Pain Trial within the ADOPT-PGx protocol.\n\nThe Chronic Pain Trial is a prospective, multicenter, two arm randomized pragmatic trial. Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to either immediate pharmacogenetic testing and genotype-guided opioid therapy (Intervention arm) or standard care with 6-month delayed pharmacogenetic testing (Control arm). The investigators will test the hypothesis that pharmacogenetic testing and genotype guided pain therapy improves pain control after surgery in participants who's body processes some pain medicines slower than normal.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Pain and depression are conditions that impact substantial proportions of the US population. Finding safe and effective drug therapies for both conditions is challenging. In the case of treatment for acute and chronic pain, the challenge is finding effective therapy while minimizing adverse effects or opioid addiction (and the ensuing consequences). For depression, there are few clinically relevant predictors of successful treatment leading to multiple trials of inadequate therapy for some patients. Both opioid and antidepressant prescriptions can be guided by pharmacogenetics (PGx) data based on existing guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC).\n\nThis study is designed to evaluate the impact of pharmacogenetic testing and genotype-guided pain or anti-depressant therapy on pain control or depression symptoms in a pragmatic setting.\n\nThe rationale for examining a genotype-guided approach to acute and chronic pain management is based on the importance of CYP2D6 for the bioactivation of tramadol, codeine, and hydrocodone and data from a pilot study supporting improved pain control in intermediate and poor CYP2D6 metabolizers in the genotype-guided arm who are taking these drugs at baseline. Similarly, the rationale for examining a genotype-guided approach to depression medication therapy is based on the demonstrated role of CYP2D6 in the bio inactivation and CYP2C19 oxidation of select, commonly used SSRIs. Secondly, data from industry sponsored trials support the hypothesis of improved depression symptom control in a genotype-guided arm.\n\nStudy objectives:\n\nDetermine if a genotype-guided approach to pain therapy in participants with at least 3 months of chronic pain leads to improved pain control compared to usual care."

                    "briefSummary": "This is an observational study in which data already collected from people with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) are studied.\n\nARDS is a life-threatening condition in which fluid builds up in the lungs making breathing difficult.\n\nIn observational studies, only observations are made without participants receiving any advice or any changes to health care.\n\nPeople who are admitted to ICU for serious illnesses, like ARDS, often experience new health problems during and after their ICU stays. These health problems that may include physical, mental, and/or emotional disorders, are called post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Identifying these new health problems early can help people by timely treatments and care.\n\nIn this study, researchers want to identify any health problems that arise after ICU admission in people with ARDS in the United States (US). To do this, researchers will collect information on health problems, treatments, medicines, and healthcare visits in people with ARDS, 1 year before and after an ICU admission.\n\nThey will then look to see whether the health problems are in areas that have been described as the post intensive care syndrome (PICS).\n\nIn addition, they will measure healthcare related costs in the one year after admission and compare it to the one year prior to admission.\n\nResearchers will also compare this information with data collected for people with pneumonia who did not require ICU admission. This will help them to identify any new health problems arising due to ICU stays.\n\nThe data will come from participants' medical claims information stored in the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database from 2016 to 2022. The claims data will only be collected for people in the US.\n\nResearchers will collect data from participants admitted to ICU for ARDS for a maximum of 1 year before and after their stay."

                    "detailedDescription": "Newly diagnosed glioblastoma:\n\nGlioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor, with a high mortality rate. The current standard of care (SoC) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma includes the combination of the alkylating agent Temozolomide (TMZ) with Radiotherapy (RT). The hypothesis of this study is to improve the outcome for participants by combining the current standard of care with the radioligand therapy \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB. Participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma enrolled into this trial will be treated with the standard regimen TMZ and RT, combined with \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 6 administrations. In cases where participants tolerate and benefit from \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB, they can receive an additional 4 doses (total up to 10 dose administrations). During this period, regular safety and efficacy assessments are planned on a weekly basis. The primary objective of this trial is to identify the recommended dose of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB in combination with TMZ and RT in participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and to characterize the safety and tolerability of this treatment. For this reason, participants will be enrolled and treated in cohorts with increasing dose levels and the totality of available data will be used to define the recommended dose. Contrast enhanced MRI assessments are to be repeated every 8 weeks. Following treatment, all participants will be followed for up to 5 additional years for safety, progression of disease and survival. Participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will undergo a baseline \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB PET/CT or PET/MRI after the surgery/biopsy of the tumor.\n\nRecurrent glioblastoma:\n\nParticipants with recurrent glioblastoma carry a dismal prognosis and a short survival. The primary objective in recurrent glioblastoma is to determine the recommended dose of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB as single agent and to characterize the safety and tolerability of this treatment. For this reason, participants will be enrolled and treated in cohorts with increasing dose levels and the totality of available data will be used to define the recommended dose. In this study, all participants with recurrent glioblastoma will undergo \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB PET scan to assess GRPR expression during the screening period. \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB will be administered as a single dose every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 6 administrations. Up to 4 additional administrations of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB may be considered if participants tolerate and benefit from \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB (total up to 10 dose administrations)."

This app will provide 1) relevant information/education about prostate cancer-specific to Black men; 2) symptoms monitoring - allowing participants to report difficulties and prompting providers to respond to concerns; and 3) testimonials from other patients with shared experiences.\n\nAll participants will be asked to complete surveys online when they start and then again at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. A subset of randomized participants will be provided access to this app, which they will be asked to use at home for 12 months. The app users will answer daily surveys about their symptoms and activities as well as weekly mood assessments for 3 months. At the end of the 12 months, interviews will be conducted to receive feedback regarding the app."

During the first 12 weeks, the application will send daily surveys about symptoms, dietary and physical activities, weekly surveys about their mood, and an assessment of their overall QoL every 3 months. The app will provide tailored educational content, including short readings, videos, and audio recordings, to help users learn more about managing symptoms and improving their functioning. After 12 months of app use, an interview will be conducted to gather feedback about their experiences with the app. The information collected from these interviews will be analyzed to further enhance and improve the app's functionality.",

                    "briefSummary": "The use of wound drains after mastectomy is common practice in Belgium. However, placement of suction drainage has several disadvantages. Skin bacteria can enter via the drain and cause infection, or the drain itself can cause discomfort and a need for daily nursing. After drain removal, seroma is the most common complication following breast cancer surgery. Seromas are collections of serous fluid that frequently develop under the skin or in the axillary space formed after mastectomy and/or axillary lymph node dissection, resulting from surgical trauma to blood/lymphatic vessels and post-traumatic inflammation. Seroma formation can cause discomfort and limitations in shoulder function. Moreover, it is associated with surgical site infections, often requires treatment and increases healthcare consumption. Wound healing problems might be a cause of postponement of adjuvant therapy.\n\nThe quilting suture technique, in which the skin is sutured to the pectoralis muscle and drain placement is not needed, may lead to a significant reduction of seroma with a decrease in the number of aspirations and surgical site infections.\n\nIn this national multicentric study, we will compare mastectomy with placement of suction drains, a standard technique used in the vast majority of Belgian hospitals, with the new quilting suture technique without placement of suction drains. We will focus on 3 distinct primary outcomes:\n\n* Pain of the mastectomy area 6 months after surgery\n* Upper limb function 6 months after surgery\n* Cosmetic outcome scored by the patient 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe goal of this study is to demonstrate the absence of long-term negative effects of the quilting suture technique on shoulder function, cosmetic outcome, and pain management."

                    "detailedDescription": "This between-subjects, double-blinded, randomized controlled pilot study will recruit patients who are receiving methadone or buprenorphine treatment for OUD and are using cocaine. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive up to 30-days of Suvorexant (SUVO) or placebo. They will visit the clinic regularly to provide urine drug screens and complete questionnaires and will wear a device that can measure their sleep parameters. We expect that relative to persons who receive placebo, individuals who receive SUVO will 1) be less likely to screen positive for cocaine and/or opioids on urine drug screens, 2) will report lower drug craving, 3) will have longer total sleep time, 4) will report fewer insomnia symptoms, and 5) will report overall lower stress than persons who receive placebo. We also expect that patients will not have side effects from SUVO. These preliminary data will inform whether this FDA-approved medication may help patients stop co-using opioids and stimulants, which can be scaled up to reduce public health consequences related to co-use."
