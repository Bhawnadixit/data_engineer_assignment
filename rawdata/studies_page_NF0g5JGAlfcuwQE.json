                    "detailedDescription": "The PRO2 study is being conducted by palleos healthcare GmbH, the sponsor of the study, with the participation of an expected 585 patients at 40 study sites in Germany and 10 study sites in the German-speaking part of Switzerland with the aim of investigating the medical benefit of the smartphone application medidux\u2122 (app) with regard to the occurrence of side effects in breast cancer therapy. Furthermore, the potential impact on the application of the chemotherapy or antibody-drug conjugate, respectively, the number of unplanned doctor visits, as well as hospitalizations and how often the app is used will be investigated.\n\nThe app was developed by mobile Health AG and is intended to accompany therapy. It is an approved CE-marked medical device that will be used in the study within the intended purpose. Study participants can use the app to document symptoms and well-being, as well as vital signs (e.g., blood pressure), and complete a test that can be used to assess mental performance. The entries can be viewed by the study physician through the medidux\u2122 web application. The study participants can refer to the entries during the treatment visit to explain the course of therapy and perceived symptoms. As part of the study, use of the app will be compared to the normal treatment routine (without the app). A randomization process will determine whether study participants receive the app. The probability of receiving the app is 50%. If study participants receive the app, it can be used after installation on the personal smartphone. The approximately 12- to a maximum of 16-week observation period begins with the regular breast cancer therapy. The specific treatment of the breast cancer is not interfered with during the study, i.e. the administration of the therapy itself is carried out in the same way as it would be without the app."

                    "briefSummary": "This phase I trial investigates the side effects and best dose of peposertib when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with head and neck cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) who cannot take cisplatin. Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. This trial aims to see whether adding peposertib to radiation therapy is safe and works well in treating patients with head and neck cancer.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of M3814 (peposertib) when given in combination with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of M3814 (peposertib) with radiotherapy.\n\nII. To estimate the rates of grade 3 or greater acute toxicities of the regimen.\n\nIII. To estimate late toxicities of the regimen. IV. To evaluate the clinical response rate, based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, at 3 months post completion of radiotherapy.\n\nV. To estimate 6 and 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) in the dose expansion cohort (DEC).\n\nVI. To estimate 6 and 12-month overall survival (OS) in the DEC.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter of M3814 (peposertib) using population PK approaches.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of peposertib.\n\nBeginning 60-90 minutes before each radiation treatment, patients receive peposertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and undergo IMRT daily Monday-Friday for 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) intravenously (IV) and undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/CT during screening and follow-up.\n\nAfter completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years."

                    "detailedDescription": "A novel, molecularly-guided, multi-arm phase umbrella II trial is proposed in children, adolescents, and young adults with newly diagnosed HGG, including DIPG, in which we will (1) conduct comprehensive molecular screening of tumor tissue using a multi-omic approach (WES/WGS, gene fusion panels/RNASeq, DNA methylation microarray) across international CONNECT genomics cores with rapid return of clinical results, (2) stratify patients to biologically-targeted treatment arms, based on the tumor molecular profile and histopathology, and (3) perform longitudinal evaluation of peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and/or tumor tissue as well as advanced neuro-imaging to determine genomic, immune, and radiologic biomarkers predictive of response, recurrence, resistance, and toxicity.\n\nBased on results of the above tumor molecular profiling and pathology-based confirmation of HGG diagnosis, eligible patients will be assigned to one of several biologically guided treatment arms on a phase II trial.\n\nApproximately 400-450 patients will be enrolled on the screening protocol through which biospecimens (paired tumor DNA/RNA and normal comparator samples) will undergo extensive molecular profiling to assess eligibility to any of the therapeutic subprotocols of the phase II study."

Diagnosis: Patients with newly diagnosed HGG, including DIPG are eligible. The diagnosis of HGG must have been confirmed by local pathology review. for the diagnosis of DIPG, patients must have a tumor with pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of at least 2/3 of the pons, with histopathology consistent with diffuse WHO grade 2-4 glioma (eg, diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, H3K27-altered diffuse midline glioma). For all other tumors, histologic grade must be WHO grade 3-4.\n3. Disease Status: There are no disease status requirements for enrollment.\n\n   * Measurable disease is not required. Patients without measurable disease are eligible.\n   * Patients with metastatic/disseminated or multifocal disease or gliomatosis cerebri are eligible.\n   * Patients with a primary spinal tumor are eligible.\n   * Patients with secondary, radiation related HGG are eligible.\n4. Prior Therapy for HGG: Surgery, radiation, and/or dexamethasone are permissible. Temozolomide concurrent with radiation is permissible, but not recommended. No other prior anticancer therapy for HGG will be allowed.\n\n   Timing from surgery to start of RT: For patients who have started RT, radiation must have started within 31 days of definitive surgery or biopsy (if patient had two surgeries, radiation must have started within 31 days from second surgery).\n5. Tumor Sample Availability OR results from previous molecular profiling/targeted sequencing\n\n   * If a patient screens through OPTION #1, tumor sample in addition to normal comparator tissue (peripheral blood or saliva) must be submitted for comprehensive molecular screening at the time of screening enrollment.\n   * If a patient screens through OPTIONS #2 or #3, results from previously performed molecular profiling must be submitted following enrollment. It is highly recommended that results be uploaded within 7 days of enrollment (if results are available at time of enrollment) or within 7 days of results becoming available (if pending at time of enrollment) to allow adequate time for central review.\n6. Informed Consent: All patients and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign a written informed consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.\n7. Enrollment timeline: Patients are eligible to enroll on the TarGeT-SCR anytime between diagnosis and the following specific timepoints post completion of RT\n\n   * Patients screening through OPTION #1 are eligible to enroll anytime between diagnosis and 10 days post RT.\n   * Patients screening through OPTIONS #2 or #3 are eligible to enroll anytime between diagnosis and 21 days post RT.\n\nHowever, it is important to note the following:\n\n* For treatment protocols that include targeted therapy administered concurrently with RT, patients must start treatment within 10 calendar days of starting RT.\n* For treatment protocols that only include maintenance/adjuvant therapy (no systemic therapy given concurrently with radiation), patients must start treatment by 35 days post RT\n\n  #SCREENING OPTIONS\n* OPTION1: Molecular screening through CONNECT TarGeT Clinical Testing Laboratories\n* OPTION2: Molecular screening through a national comprehensive tumor profiling program\n* OPTION3: Clinically validated targeted sequencing or focused profiling\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n-Tumors that do not meet HGG and DIPG diagnoses specified above",

                    "detailedDescription": "Epidemiological studies have reported that between 30 and 50% of patients with kidney disease show signs of malnutrition and that specifically in patient with CKD in stages 4-5 without replacement therapy, the prevalence of protein energy wasting (PEW) can be up to 45%.\n\nMany factors influence the development of PEW, however, one main factor is insufficient intake of energy and macronutrients. The main obstacle that prevents the patient from meeting their nutritional requirements is the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition to this, dietary restrictions, lack of adherence to eating plans and the presence of digestive and psychological abnormalities of the patient, contribute directly to the patient directly contribute to insufficient energy and protein intake. Therefore, there is a need for evidence-based nutritional treatment strategies that facilitate the patient's achievement of their nutritional requirements and maintain or improve their nutritional supplements in patients with CKD has been shown to be a good treatment strategy.\n\nSpecifically in patients with CKD without replacement therapy, it has been observed that the use of specialized nutritional supplements can contribute to increasing their energy, fat, and fiber intake, while at the same time achieving a decrease in protein intake without causing any change in serum minerals or electrolytes.\n\nThis project will provide practical information for the validation of the therapeutic effect of a new specialized food supplement on the nutritional status and quality of life in patients with CKD without replacement therapy, which will be useful both for health professionals and for the patients themselves.\n\nMAIN OBJETIVE:\n\nTo assess the effect and safety of the use of a specialized food supplement on the nutritional status and quality of life of patients with CKD and PEW without replacement therapy.\n\nSTUDIO DESING:\n\nRandomized, blinded clinical trial with an intervention period of 4 months.\n\nPROCESS:\n\n1. Identify those patients who are candidates to participate in the clinical trial.\n2. Review the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n3. Invite identified patients to participate in the clinical trial.\n\nPre - Nutritional wash out appointment - nutritionist\n\n1. Evaluate inclusion criteria.\n2. Review and sign the informed consent.\n3. Perform evaluation to indicate a personalized meal plan.\n4. Deliver a meal plan.\n5. Schedule in 30 days for your next nutritional appointment.\n\n0 - Full Assessment Nutritional Appointment - Nutritionist\n\n1. Evaluate adherence to the meal plan (percentage of adequacy of energy and protein consumption from 70% to 130%).\n2. Assign an intervention group randomly (sealed envelope).\n3. Perform an evaluation of nutritional status, quality of life and body composition.\n\n   Offer nutritional treatment according to the assigned intervention group.\n4. Schedule an immediate appointment for laboratory tests of blood and urine.\n5. Schedule in 30 days for your next nutritional appointment.\n\nmonth 1 - Nutritional monitoring appointment - nutritionist\n\n1. Evaluate adherence to the eating plan.\n2. Offer nutritional treatment according to the assigned intervention group.\n3. Schedule in 30 days for your next nutritional appointment.\n4. Make an appointment a few days before your next nutritional appointment to perform blood and urine lab tests.\n\nmonth 2 - Full Assessment Nutritional Appointment - Nutritionist\n\n1. Perform an evaluation of nutritional status, quality of life and body composition.\n2. Offer nutritional treatment according to the assigned intervention group.\n3. Schedule in 30 days for your next nutritional appointment.\n\nmonth 3 - Nutritional monitoring appointment - nutritionist\n\n1. Evaluate adherence to the eating plan.\n2.

Perform an evaluation of nutritional status, quality of life and body composition.\n2. Offer nutritional treatment according to the assigned intervention group.\n\nSAMPLE SIZE: 50 participants\n\nSTATISTIC ANALYSIS:\n\nFor the comparison of proportions between the groups, it will be done with X2 or Fisher's exact test and to compare quantitative variables, Student's T or Mann-Whitney U will be used. For the intra-group comparisons, Mc Nemar will be used for the qualitative variables and Anova for repeated samples or Friedman's Anova for the quantitative variables. For the analysis of the interaction or intervening variables, a stratified statistical analysis will be carried out, using contingency tables and the Mantel-Haenszel method. The results will be considered statistically significant if the value of p \\<0.05."

The study will adopt a closed cohort with repeated measurements on the same participants (nurses in DRC and junior doctors in Baghdad) and will involve the unidirectional transition of each enrolled cluster (health facilities in DRC and secondary hospitals in Baghdad) from the control (no intervention) to the intervention sequence in a randomized sequential manner according to a predefined roll out process."

The Magnap device consists of a neodymium-iron-boron rare earth magnet with a ferromagnetic directional back-plate encased in titanium. The device will be implanted surgically on the hyoid bone. Following surgery, the patient is fitted with a custom, removable external neck accessory containing a second magnet, which is worn during sleep and prevents airway collapse by attracting the internal hyoid magnet with sufficient force to keep the airway open ."
