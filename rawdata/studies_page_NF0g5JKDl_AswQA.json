To develop and test the feasibility of a standardized 12-week online hatha yoga intervention (n=30) of breathing and movement incorporating both restorative poses, breathing techniques, guided meditation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the yoga intervention in relation to self-reported levels of stress and quality of life in cancer survivors (n=30).\n\nII. Feasibility of collecting blood and saliva at baseline and post-intervention for stress biomarkers, including cortisol and norepinephrine.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine how behavior change, quality of life (QoL), and biomarkers of adrenergic stress, inflammation, and immunosuppression are affected by a 12-week online yoga program completed by cancer survivors.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive online yoga intervention once a week (QW) for 12 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months."

                    "briefSummary": "The investigators are interested in how skeletal muscle processes fat and how this may affect insulin resistance. This is an important question since insulin resistance predates and predicts type 2 diabetes. The investigators are especially interested in learning about the effects of weight and training on insulin resistance. The investigators will study people before and after supervised aerobic or yoga training to identify differences in resting fat and sugar metabolism which may lead to differences in insulin resistance. The investigators will test these differences using stable isotopes, and the use of these stable isotopes is experimental.\n\nOverweight/Obese Group: Eight visits will be required at the University of Minnesota Clinical Research Unit. Four visits will be done before training (screen and 3 pre-training visits), 1 visit during the training, and 3 post-training visits will be done. In between, the training will take about 16 weeks and will be a supervised treadmill program.\n\nLean/Trained Group: Four visits will be required at the University of Minnesota Clinical Research Unit (screen and 3 study visits).",
                    "detailedDescription": "Insulin resistance plays a critical role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with skeletal muscle the largest site of insulin resistance in the human body. In sedentary humans, insulin resistance correlates with levels of intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and lipid metabolites that adversely affect skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. However, even modest endurance training has been shown to reduce insulin resistance while increasing skeletal muscle IMCL. Moreover, lean endurance trained participants have IMCL levels comparable to those of patients with T2DM, yet have significantly lower insulin resistance. These findings suggest that the physiological changes caused by training protect against lipid induced insulin resistance and that this protection is present even at rest, however our preliminary data suggest that training facilitates utilization of readily available fuel, with lipid preferentially used over glucose when available. We will test the overarching hypothesis that training increases resting skeletal muscle lipid metabolism, as measured by markers of IMCL lipolysis, accumulation of fatty acid metabolites and mitochondrial utilization of fatty acids.\n\nResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health Award Number UL1-TR002494.

Cohort_A, B, and Cohort_C Stage I patients who had failed or were intolerant to 1 or more lines of systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (non-nasopharyngeal carcinoma);\n   2. Cohort_C Stage II patients who had not received any previous systemic antitumor therapy (other than induction chemotherapy, neoadjuvant, or adjuvant therapy) for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (non-nasopharyngeal); Treatment failure was defined as disease progression during or after systemic antitumor therapy.\n\n   Intolerance refers to the refusal of patients to continue the original regimen due to grade 3-4 adverse reactions after receiving standard treatment.\n\n   Note: Recurrence or disease progression within 6 months after the last chemotherapy of multimodal therapy was considered as the first line of treatment.\n6. Consent to provide archival tumor tissue specimens (10-12 unstained sections (anti-slip) surgical specimens (thickness 4-5\u03bcm)) or fresh tissue samples from primary or metastatic lesions within 3 years. If participants cannot provide tumor tissue samples, they can be enrolled if they meet other inclusion and exclusion criteria after the evaluation of the investigator.\n7. Must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1 definition; Lesions that had been previously treated with radiation could be included in a measurable lesion only if there was definite disease progression after radiation therapy.\n8. No blood transfusions and no use of cell growth factors and/or platelet-raising drugs during the 14 days prior to the screening period must be allowed, and the organ function level must meet the following criteria:\n\n   1.

                    "briefSummary": "De Quervain's tenosynovitis (DQT) was originally identified by Swiss surgeon Fritz de Quervain in 1895. It is a condition involving the entrapment of tendons within the first dorsal compartment of the wrist. In DQT, the sheaths surrounding the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis tendons thicken as they pass through a fibro-osseous tunnel near the radial styloid of the distal wrist. This thickening leads to pain, which worsens with thumb movements and radial or ulnar deviation of the wrist. Traditional treatment methods, such as corticosteroid injections and physical therapy, often provide only temporary relief and may not address the underlying inflammation effectively. Intralesional platelet rich plasma (PRP) therapy has emerged as a promising alternative, utilizing the patient's own growth factors and cytokines to promote healing and reduce inflammation. By investigating the efficacy of intralesional PRP in patients with DQT, this research aims to provide evidence for a minimally invasive treatment option that could enhance recovery times, reduce pain, and improve functional outcomes."

                    "briefSummary": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often causes persistent motor and cognitive deficits in children resulting in functional limitations. We are testing a brain stimulation method along with evaluating objective tools to help record and restore communication among affected brain areas, which will facilitate recovery in youth after mTBI.",
                    "detailedDescription": "About 1.9 million children sustain mTBI per year from sports injuries alone in the US. In about 30% of children, the cognitive-motor effects of mTBI interrupt typical neurodevelopment leading to chronic neurological conditions. The limited evidence available on mTBI suggests that residual symptoms may involve the brain stem (BS); the subcortical region that is now shown to influence cognitive-motor control. The BS also has functional interconnections to other cortical regions involved in cognitive-motor learning such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and primary motor cortex. While clinicians examine certain risk factors such as amnesia and history of prior concussions, they lack objective biomarkers to accurately predict the post-mTBI prognosis in children, and to accurately guide treatment. Further, there is no evidence-based standard of care established, so children may be released to pre-injury activity levels before full neurophysiological recovery, predisposing them to further mTBI and associated sequelae.\n\nTranscranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive treatment, has been demonstrated to positively influence cognitive-motor control by modulating the excitability of both cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, resting state functional connectivity has shown promise in diagnosing and predicting recovery in adult TBI. However, the efficacy of tDCS for children with mTBI is not yet established due to their atypical cortical activity and variable symptomology. Consequently, we aim to determine the efficacy of tDCS for promoting recovery in 10 youths (aged 10 to 15 years) who exhibit persistent symptoms of mTBI using a cross-over design compared with 10 never-injured youths as controls, and to test the application of neural correlates to provide insights into their functional change and recovery by comparing group differences."

In Step 1 (Specific Aim #1), identify the necessary adaptations to the content, language, and format of an ACT-based self-help workbook through stakeholder input.\n2. In Step 2 (Specific Aim #2), refine the workbook and its delivery based on feedback from incarcerated individuals who complete the workbook.\n3. In Step 3 (Specific Aim #3), determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the ACT self-help workbook in a prison setting. Primary clinical outcome measure will be depression, secondary clinical outcome measure will be anxiety.\n\nFor each participant assigned to a condition, a study team member will meet with them individually to provide them with a copy of the workbook. During this meeting, the study team member will inform the participant that they should complete one chapter per week.\n\nParticipants will complete a Pre-Treatment Assessment prior to distribution of the workbook; a Mid-Treatment Assessment four weeks after the distribution of the workbook; a Post-Treatment Assessment #1 eight weeks after distribution of the workbook (when the workbook should be completed); Focus group (after completion of workbook) and, a Post-Treatment Assessment #2 twelve weeks after distribution of the workbook."
