Screening for breast cancer with tomosynthesis mammography may be superior to digital mammography for breast cancer screening and may help reduce the need for additional imaging or treatment.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the proportions of participants in the tomosynthesis mammography (TM) and digital mammography (DM) study arms experiencing the occurrence of an ?advanced? breast cancer at any time during a period of 4.5 years from randomization, including the period of active screening and a period of clinical follow-up after the last screen (T4).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the potential effect of age, menopausal and hormonal status, breast density, and family cancer history on the primary endpoint difference between the two arms.\n\nII. To compare the diagnostic performance of TM and DM, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).\n\nIII. To compare the recall rates and biopsy rates for TM versus DM, with subset analyses by the same variables as listed in aim II.\n\nIV. To compare the rate of interval cancers for TM and DM and to assess the mechanism of diagnosis for these interval cancers with categorization by symptomatic versus (vs) asymptomatic, and how detected: diagnosed via physical examination, mammography, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other technologies.\n\nV. To examine the correlation between Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) imaging features and histologic and genetic features, such as invasive ductal and invasive lobular histology, high grade, high stage at diagnosis, and aggressive genetic subtypes.\n\nVI. To assess different combinations of TM and synthesized 2 dimensional (2D) or DM in reader studies to assist in determining the optimum balance between diagnostic performance, radiation exposure and technique.\n\nVII. To estimate and compare breast-cancer-specific mortality between the two study arms.\n\nVIII. To estimate and compare the prevalence of breast cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2+, basal-like) low, medium or high proliferation via PAM50 proliferation signatures, and p53 mutant-like or wild-type-like according to a validated p53 dependent signature in the two arms, overall and stratified on whether cancers were detected through screening or as interval cancers, and whether cancers were invasive or in situ.\n\nIX. To classify histologically malignant (true positive cases) and benign lesions (false positive cases) as normal-like or tumor-like using the PAM50 gene expression assay subtype (luminal A, luminal B, HER2, basal-like,), and low, medium, or high proliferation according to PAM50 proliferation signatures, and p53 mutant-like or wild-type-like according to a validated p53-dependent signature.\n\nX. To assess the agreement between local and expert study pathologists for all breast lesions (benign and malignant) biopsied during the 4.5 years of screening with TM or DM.\n\nXI. To create a blood and buccal cell biobank for future biomarker and genetic testing.\n\nXII. To compare health care utilization (including cancer care received) and cost of an episode of breast cancer screening by TM versus DM, overall and within subsets.\n\nXIII. To implement a centralized quality control (QC) monitoring program for both 2D digital mammography (DM) and tomosynthesis (TM), which provides rapid feedback on image quality, using quantitative tools, taking advantage of the automated analysis of digital images.\n\nXIV. To assess temporal and site-to site variations in image quality, breast radiation dose, and other quality control parameters in TM vs. DM.\n\nXV. To refine and implement task-based measures of image quality to assess the effects of technical parameters, including machine type, and detector spatial and contrast resolution on measures of diagnostic accuracy for TM.\n\nXVI. To evaluate which QC tests are useful for determination of image quality and those that are predictive of device failure, in order to recommend an optimal QC program for TM.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients undergo bilateral screening DM with standard craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views at baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months if pre-menopausal or at baseline, 24, and 48 months if post-menopausal.\n\nARM B: Patients undergo manufacturer-defined screening TM at baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months if pre-menopausal or at baseline, 24, and 48 months if post-menopausal.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up for at least 3- 8 years after study entry."

Intervention group participants will meet virtually with other community member participants in small discussion groups once a week for one hour over the course of 12 weeks. The online discussion groups will be led by peer mentor facilitators and supported by a research team member. Discussion topics will include current events, COVID-19, and other health related topics. Control group participants will not meet in weekly discussion groups. At approximately the 0 month, 3 month, and 6 month time points, all participants will answer online surveys about health related topics. At the 3 month and 6 month time points, all participants will also be asked to self-administer a COVID-19 test that investigators provide. Finally, around the fourth month, intervention group participants will be invited to an online feedback session with the research team about participants' experiences in the study."

During the 1995 Chicago heat wave, there was 35% increase in hospital admissions for individuals older than 65 years of age. Moreover, adults over the age of 65 have a heat-related death rate that is more than double any other age group. Therefore, with an increasing elderly population that is expected to rise by 60% (to 78 million) by 2035, the causes of this excess mortality must be understood to better protect the ageing United States population. It is notable that selective and non-selective beta blocker drugs are commonly prescribed to older individuals with cardiovascular diseases. In younger individuals exposed to a heat stress, beta blocker administration reduced whole-body sweat rate and skin blood flow responses resulting in greater increases in core body temperature. Notably, nothing is known regarding the effects of beta blockers on thermoregulatory responses during heat exposure in older individuals.\n\nThis project will evaluate core body temperature responses to selective and non-selective beta blocker drugs during simulated heat wave exposure in older individuals."

Drug or placebo will be administered. Participants will then enter the environmental chamber and will be seated in a semi-recumbent position on a chair with breathable fabric to minimize impediments to heat dissipation. Periodically throughout the simulated heat-wave participants will lightly exercise to simulate metabolic heat production associated with activities of daily living (\\~3 metabolic equivalents; METS). Throughout the heat-wave simulation trials we comprehensively evaluate the thermoregulatory and cardiovascular responses.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with carboplatin may work better in treating patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.",

Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on the trial.\n\nAfter the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months for year 1, and every 6 months for year 2."

The investigators will conduct a randomized crossover design study. Non-burned control subjects, subjects who experienced burns covering \\~20% to 40% of their body surface area, and subject having burns \\>40% of their body surface area will be investigated. Subjects will exercise in heated environmental conditions while receiving the following cooling modalities: no cooling, fan only, skin wetting only, and a combination of fan and skin wetting.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Within the United States, 500,000+ individuals are enduring the long-term consequences of severe burn injuries covering 20% or more of their body surface area, with upwards to 11,000 individuals experiencing such an injury per year. These burn injuries can severely compromise body temperature regulation, owing to permanent impairments in the primary thermoeffectors necessary to dissipate heat, namely profoundly blunted skin blood flow and sweating responses in the injured skin. The investigators propose that this heat intolerance deters burn survivors from participating in physical activity, including activities of daily living, necessary to avoid the adverse cardiovascular and metabolic sequela of a sedentary lifestyle. Consistent with hypothesis, years after the injury burn survivors have a very low aerobic capacity; greater all-cause mortality rates; greater hospitalization days for circulatory diseases; and suffer from greater incidences of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease (including stroke) relative to matched non-burned cohorts. The primary goal of this project is to identify modalities to attenuate excessive elevations in skin and core body temperatures during physical activity in well-healed burn survivors. The implementation of such modalities will eliminate heat intolerance as a barrier to participation in activities that are necessary to improve/maintain cardiovascular health in this vulnerable population. This project will investigate whether increased skin wetness, with and without accompanying fan use, will restore otherwise impaired evaporative cooling of well-healed burn survivors, with the extent of that improvement predicated on the environmental conditions and the percentage of body surface area burned."

After the participant has been deemed an appropriate candidate for the study and has signed the consent form, they will be enrolled. All participants will be started on guselkumab 100mg at the FDA-approved psoriasis dose and will be seen for clinical follow-up 4, 12, 24 weeks after initiation of therapy. A 12-week follow-up period will be conducted post-administration of the final dose of guselkumab to monitor safety. Laboratory monitoring including Complete Blood Count, Basic metabolic panel, Liver function tests, and pregnancy test (if applicable) will also be performed at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after starting therapy. At each visit except Week 20 a full H\\&P, complete Review of Systems and physical examination will be performed. Outcomes will be assessed and full-body photography will be performed at each visit except Week 20. Research tissue samples (skin biopsies) will be obtained at baseline (prior to therapy) after 24 weeks of treatment in all participants. Research blood will be obtained at screening, baseline and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of guselkumab therapy."

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess if the use of an audiovisual animated video, describing the gynecological procedure (hysteroscopy) the patient is about to undergo, will help to reduce the patient's level of anxiety, affect her anesthesia parameters and increase their overall satisfaction from the procedure.\n\nOur hypothesis is that patient who will watch the video (intervention group) will experience less anxiety, will have lower heart rate and lower blood pressure during the procedure, and have overall more satisfaction with the procedure, compared to patients who will not watch the preoperative video (control group).\n\nPatients will be asked to rate their anxiety level before the procedure and their satisfaction afterwards.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Is has been questioned what the effectiveness of various modes of delivering preoperative education in reducing preoperative anxiety is and as a result pain and overall satisfaction of patients from surgical producers. It is known that women undergoing hysteroscopy suffer from significant levels of anxiety, with repercussions on pain perception, success rates and satisfaction (1). In the inpatient surgery setting, preoperative anxiety is commonly managed by means of pharmacological interventions such as the use of anxiolytics and sedatives. Communication and patient education have been proved as effective tools to reduce preoperative anxiety, and their role should be increasingly acknowledged, now that many patients are active consumers of unfiltered and largely unreliable information through the Internet.\n\nOne meta-analysis which included 14 interventional trials (1) concluded that preoperative education interventions are promising in reducing preoperative anxiety in patients scheduled for surgical procedures (1).\n\nObjective To assess if the use of an audiovisual animated video describing the gynecological procedure (hysteroscopy) the patient is about to undergo will help to reduce the patient's level of anxiety, affect her anesthesia parameters and increase their overall satisfaction from the procedure.\n\nDesign A randomized control trial including the patients undergoing operative hysteroscopy under anesthesia in the operation room via the endoscopy unit's team, Shamir hospital, Israel.\n\nInclusion criteria: adult patients (above 18 and older), undergoing operative hysteroscopy under anesthesia in our OR due to uterine findings previously diagnosed during diagnostic hysteroscopy.\n\nExclusion criteria: Patients who patient who are not able to watch the audiovisual video or who cannot sign a consent form.\n\nThe research would require a total 100 patients. The sample sign is based upon a previous study done in our institute assessing the effect of an audiovisual video on anxiety levels of patients undergoing diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy without anesthesia.\n\nThe patients would be randomly divided into the Intervention and Nonintervention group. Patients would be requested to fill up a questionnaire\n\n1. Intervention group: traditional patient education (nurse + physician pre-procedural counseling) + supplemental animation video describing the procedure itself and what to expect from it. This group will receive a code they ca scan so they can watch the video before entering the examination room where the physician will see them and where the hysteroscopy will be performed.\n2. The Nonintervention group would receive the traditional patient education before the procedure (via the team's nurse and the doctor performing the procedure) and would be unaware of the animation video in order to avoid bias in the questionnaire.\n\nThe patients in the interventional arm will be introduced to video will be introduced to a concise, animated video explaining the steps they are about to undergo in the department, the OR, recovery and discharge. How to prepare for the procedure, what to expect during and after the procedure and what are the possible follow up scenarios.\n\nIn order to overcome language berries videos would be available in basic 6th grader language and translated into English, Arabic and Russian for the non-Hebrew speaking population.\n\nThere would be one staff member aware of the patient's allocation the international Vs nonintervention arm while the rest of the staff would be masked to the research arm the patient was allocated to.\n\nOnce they have watched the video they would be asked to fill up a questionnaire their anxiety level concerning the procedure (STAI-S).\n\nFor each patient the performing physician would fill up a basic demographic questionnaire (age, weight, obstetrical history, chronic diseases and medications) and after completing the procedure - information regarding the intrauterine findings and the procedure itself (actual finding, size and location of the finding, procedural length, instruments used, etc).\n\nAnesthesia parameters during the operative hysteroscopy would also be measured including the patients' blood pressure, pulse and BIS and amount of anesthetic agents in order to assess the anesthesia.\n\nIn the context of anesthesia, PSI (Patient state Index) is a monitoring tool used to assess the depth of anesthesia in patients during surgery. It helps anesthesiologists ensure that a patient is neither too deeply nor too lightly anesthetized, aiming for an optimal balance. It uses sensors placed on the patient's forehead to measure electrical activity in the brain (EEG) and processes these signals and calculates a PSI value between 0-100. Score of 25-50 is the target range for general anesthesia, suggesting an adequate depth of anesthesia where the patient is unlikely to be conscious or aware. 50\\< may indicate a lighter plane of anesthesia where there is a risk of consciousness while 100 means fully awake and alert. By monitoring BIS, anesthesiologists can adjust the amount of anesthetic agents in real-time to maintain appropriate anesthesia levels, avoiding both under-dosing (which can lead to awareness) and over-dosing (which can cause prolonged recovery times or side effects). PSI is used alongside other clinical assessments and monitoring devices, such as heart rate and blood pressure, to guide anesthesia management."
