When a recommended dose (RD) has been declared, a monotherapy expansion cohort will be open at that dose level.\n\nIn Part 1 participants will receive a 123I-ATT001 dose, once per week, for four weeks (+ two optional extra cycles).\n\n* Part 2 is a dose expansion study where one dose of 123I-AT001 will be tested in combination with other therapies. Part 2 will begin after the Part 1 has completed and a recommended part 2 dose has been chosen.\n\nThe specific details and combination therapies for Part 2 of the study will be added via a protocol amendment at a later date."

                    "briefSummary": "The overall goal of this research is to test a new model of speech motor learning, whose central hypothesis is that learning and retention are associated with plasticity not only in motor areas of the brain but in auditory and somatosensory regions as well. The strategy for the proposed research is to identify individual brain areas that contribute causally to retention by disrupting their activity with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Investigators will also use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which will enable identification of circuit-level activity which predicts either learning or retention of new movements, and hence test the specific contributions of candidate sensory and motor zones. In other studies, investigators will record sensory and motor evoked potentials over the course of learning to determine the temporal order in which individual sensory and cortical motor regions contribute. The goal here is to identify brain areas in which learning-related plasticity occurs first and which among these areas predict subsequent learning.",

The work in Specific Aim 1 involves tests of speech motor memory retention following disruption of left hemisphere brain activity in either auditory, somatosensory or motor cortex or to a control site (hand area motor cortex right hemisphere). Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) is delivered following adaptation to altered auditory feedback to assess its effects on the retention of new learning. In the adaptation task, participants read Harvard Sentences aloud, which are presented on a computer monitor. Vocal output is altered in real-time and played back to participants through headphones. Tests of retention are conducted 24 hours later.\n\nThe Speech Motor Learning and Retention Master Protocol has uniqueID 2000037622."

                    "briefSummary": "Background Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome, and its causes remain complex and not fully comprehended. Patients in trauma intensive care units are at high risk for delirium and are greatly affected by its adverse outcomes. As there are currently no effective pharmacological treatments or approaches for delirium, it is crucial to focus on identifying the risk factors for delirium and implementing early prevention strategies.\n\nObjective Analyzing the incidence and risk factors of delirium in trauma intensive care unit patients.\n\nMethod This study is a prospective research that focuses on all patients in the trauma intensive care unit of a medical center. Data collection will be conducted through questionnaires and electronic medical records. A total of 200 participants will be conveniently selected for the study. Upon admission to the intensive care unit, each patient will complete a basic information questionnaire, and their medical records will be collected daily until they are discharged from the intensive care unit. The study incorporates various assessment scales including Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC), Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II), Injury Severity Score (ISS), and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST). Statistical analysis will be done by using IBM SPSS 24.0 for Windows. Descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, and percentages will be used to present demographic information. Logistic regression analysis will be applied to identify the key predictive factors for delirium risk.\n\nExpected outcome and clinical application This study anticipates that the non-modifiable risk factors for trauma intensive care unit patients include age, substance use, chronic diseases, traumatic brain injury, prior surgery, frailty, APACHE II score, ISS, and ASA anesthesia classification. The modifiable risk factors include malnutrition, polypharmacy, electrolyte deficiency, metabolic acidosis, pain, mechanical ventilation, physical restraints, total surgical duration, intraoperative blood loss, and low hemoglobin. By understanding these risk factors, high-risk patients can be identified and preventive measures can be implemented to reduce the occurrence of delirium. Furthermore, addressing modifiable risk factors can help in reducing the risk or severity of delirium."

                    "briefSummary": "The concept of \"Microbiota-gut-brain axis\" has long been elucidated. However, only few microbiota-related radionuclide imaging studies have been published. The etiology of physiologic bowel FDG uptake is not fully understood. Some previous studies suggested that bacteria play a role in accumulating FDG and the variability of intestinal FDG activity may rely on a specific type of bacteria in the lumen. It is unclear if FDG transfer from the blood to the bowel lumen through a transcellular or paracellular pathways. The GLUT transporters are known to export glucose from mucosal cells to the blood, but it is doubtful they can also transport in the opposite direction. Therefore, some research speculated the focal or intense FDG uptake might be caused by an increase in intestinal permeability and reflects intestinal barrier impairment.\n\nGut microbiota compositional changes may affect pathogenesis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A previous hypothesis of PD pointed disease originates in the enteric nervous system and spreads via autonomic neurons to the brain, eventually causing PD. Besides, several studies support the clinical use of Tc-99m TRODAT-1 SPECT in assessing the neurodegenerative status of PD. To date, the correlation between physiologic bowel FDG uptake and dopamine transporter degeneration, as evaluated by either semiquantitative or visual analyses, has never been elucidated.\n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the pattern of intestinal FDG activity and Tc-99m TRODAT-1 SPECT images based on the theory of \"Microbiota-gut-brain axis\".",
                    "detailedDescription": "The key role of gut microbiota in keeping local and systemic homeostasis is termed the \"Microbiota-gut-brain axis\", which is a complex bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. The hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis takes part to this bidirectional communication by releasing corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), which facilitates the release of adenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary, which enters systemic circulation to lead to the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands. Many reports indicating that this hormonal cascade has a significant role in the adjustment of several functions like gastrointestinal transit, visceral sensation and permeability of the intestinal wall.\n\nThe etiology of intestinal FDG uptake without pathologic lesions is not fully understood. Tohihara et al. reported physiologic bowel FDG activity at the delayed phase was more than that at the early phase in dual-time images, and postulated FDG secretion was the major cause of physiologic uptake. Franquet et al. reported that physiologic bowel FDG uptake was inhibited by antibiotics, such as rifaximin. Some studies proposed that a specific type of bacteria in the lumen plays a role in gathering FDG, and it explain individual differences in physiologic bowel FDG activity. Previous studies debated about if FDG transfer from the blood to the bowel lumen through a transcellular or paracellular pathways. The GLUT transporters are known to export glucose from mucosal cells to the blood, but it is doubtful they can also transport in the opposite direction. If bowel FDG uptake is associated to intestinal permeability, FDG is likely to migrate through a paracellular pathway because intestinal permeability is adjusted by paracellular tight junction.\n\nThere is strong evidence that microbial strains may generate neuroactive molecules such as neurotransmitters, which may interfere with gut and brain functions. Furthermore, gut microbiota compositional changes may affect pathogenesis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A previous hypothesis of PD pointed disease originates in the enteric nervous system and spreads via autonomic neurons to the brain, eventually causing PD. Besides, several studies support the clinical use of Tc-99m TRODAT-1 SPECT in assessing the neurodegenerative status of PD.\n\nTo date, no radionuclide imaging studies for correlation between physiologic bowel FDG uptake and dopamine transporter degeneration have been elucidated. The investigators hope to have insight into pathophysiology of PD by investigating the association between the pattern of intestinal FDG activity and Tc-99m TRODAT-1 SPECT images. In addition, research in this field opens the possibility to use neuroactive molecule-producing probiotics as new potential therapeutic tools for patients with PD."

It is a retrospective population-based tissue sample study in men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer 1990-2006, inclusively. Initially the cohort comprised men diagnosed with prostate cancer with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and needle biopsies 1990-1996, but was expanded from 2005 to include men diagnosed with prostate cancer 1990 - 2006. Data was collected from six regional cancer registries and eligibility was confirmed via hospital sites, which sent the relevant tissue samples to the TAPG Central Coordinating Office (CCO). Selection of eligible patients for the study completed in 2010. Since this year the TAPG CCO has been collecting cancer registration and mortality updates on the cohort members from regional cancer registries."

Patients should have (but are not required to have) tissue blocks available for review.\n* There must be no evidence of metastatic disease\n* While data collection will include review of the reports of any imaging studies of the prostate, bones, or soft tissues, these studies are not essential\n* Each patient should have had an adequate medical evaluation to document the status of disease for the first five years after diagnosis. Follow-up should include an annual PSA and digital rectal examination. Records will be reviewed to seek all information about medical evaluation after the time of diagnosis.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients older than 76 years at the time of diagnosis\n* Patients who have not had a baseline serum PSA level measured before starting any treatment\n* Patients who do not have the initial diagnosis biopsy sample for review\n* Patients with evidence of metastatic disease",

                    "detailedDescription": "This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ZILRETTA in subjects with glenohumeral OA. This study will be conducted at approximately 25 study sites in the United States. Subjects will be screened to confirm the diagnosis of OA and eligibility based on the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Approximately 250 male or female subjects, 50 to 80 years of age inclusive, will be enrolled, randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (2:2:1), and treated with a single IA injection of either:\n\n* Treatment Arm 1: 32 mg ZILRETTA,\n* Treatment Arm 2: 40 mg Immediate Release Triamcinolone (TCA-IR), or\n* Treatment Arm 3: placebo (normal saline). ZILRETTA, TCA-IR, or normal saline placebo will be administered as a single IA injection with a 24-week follow-up period with a primary endpoint at Week 12.\n\nThe study will involve a Screening period (a minimum of 10 days, up to a maximum of 35 days), pre-treatment phase, dosing at Baseline/Day 1, and 8 additional outpatient visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, and 24/End of Study (EOS) during the study.\n\nAt specified times throughout the study, subjects will undergo physical examinations, index shoulder assessments, and index shoulder X-rays; blood will be collected for laboratory safety tests; and vital signs will be collected.\n\nInformation regarding adverse events (AEs) and prior and concomitant medications and treatments will be collected from the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) through the Week 24/EOS visit. Information regarding rescue medication usage, Average and Worst daily Pain score (0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS); 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain) in the index shoulder, and Sleep Interference (SI) will be completed daily via an electronic diary (eDiary) and reviewed for compliance by site staff at each study visit.\n\nAt the Screening Visit, subjects will be registered in the eDiary and receive instructions on its use. Subjects will complete accurate pain reporting (APR) and placebo response reduction (PRR) training prior to completing all questionnaires."

                    "briefSummary": "In severe cases after craniotomy, tracheal intubation is often required, and the removal of tracheal intubation presents certain risks and challenges. Premature removal of the tracheal intubation can lead to failure of extubation and increased proportion of re-intubation, resulting in increased risk of airway injury and hospital-acquired pneumonia, resulting in prolonged hospital stay and even adverse effects on neurological outcomes and mortality. However, delayed extubation can also lead to an increased risk of hospital acquired pneumonia, affecting early recovery and neurological recovery. It can be seen that the accurate evaluation of the possibility of tracheal intubation and the appropriate timing can have a greater impact on the prognosis of patients after craniotomy. However, there are currently no relevant standards or guidelines to guide clinical work. Previous studies have shown that for general critically ill patients, Peak cough flow (PCF) can play a certain role in predicting tracheal intubation, but the results of each study are not consistent. The predictive value of PCF for tracheal intubation and extubation in patients after craniotomy is less relevant. This study intends to use Pneumotachograph to measure the active and passive PCF of patients with extubation, to explore the predictive value of PCF for tracheal intubation after craniotomy, and to provide guidance for the development of clinical extubation decisions.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The objection of this study is to evaluate the preditive value of PCF for endotracheal extubation in patients undergoing craniotomy. For patients who met the inclusion criteria, the PCF value will be measured before the removal of entracheal tubes, and the predictive value of PCF will be evaluated by ROC curves, as will as the cut-off value of PCF.\n\nAccording to state of consciousness, patients will be grouped as consciousness and unconsciousness group, and the predictive value of PCF for endotracheal extubation will be evaluated seprately in both groups. For patients with disturbance of consciousness, only passive PCF value will be measured. For lucid patients, inaddition to passive PCF value, the voluntary PCF value will also be measured."

                    "briefSummary": "ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) is an IL-6 receptor antagonist used for the treatment of adult Rheumatoid Arthritis as well as Polyarticular (PJIA) and Systemic (SJIA) Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. In this Phase II, the drug will be used to treat pediatric patients diagnosed with recurrent Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma including patients who have undergone surgery and/or radiation therapy.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a highly debilitating pediatric brain tumor that lacks medical anti-tumor therapies. Current therapy, which depends largely on surgery and radiation, is associated with poor quality of life and becomes more challenging and risky in the setting of recurrent disease. Recent discoveries regarding the biological characteristics of ACP indicate that available agents, including IL-6 pathway blockers may have efficacy in the control of ACP. We hypothesize that the IL6- receptor antagonist ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) will be safe and effective at inducing tumor response in children with residual ACP.\n\nIn this study, up to 38 patients will receive tocilizumab at the dose approved for pediatric Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (\\< 30 kg: 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks; \u226530 kg: 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks). Therapy may continue for up to two years (26 cycles).\n\nIt will be a multi-center Phase 2 trial with two strata for patients aged \\>1 year and \\<25 years with unresectable ACP who may have been previously treated with radiation (Stratum 1, 18 patients) or without radiation (Stratum 2, 18 patients)."
