Through recruitment partner agencies, the investigators will recruit a sample of 49 at-risk families (49 primary parents, 49 target children). Primary parents will be assessed at enrollment via online an questionnaire, then provided an Amazon Echo Dot and asked to use the Bedtime Routine module for 4 weeks. They will then be re-assessed with the online questionnaire at 4 weeks (at treatment completion). Although children were considered enrolled participants that actively participate in the intervention, we obtained no assessment data from the children themselves.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Parents provide consent for their own participation, as well as the participation of their target child (their child aged 3-5 years who presents the most behavioral challenges). After consent, primary parents complete the baseline (T1) questionnaire via the Qualtrics online assessment platform and then are provided an Echo Dot with the Bedtime Routine module enabled. After 4 weeks post-baseline, they are administered the T2 questionnaire. This design allows evaluation of T1-T2 change and satisfaction/usability of the Bedtime Routine prototype module. Although children were considered enrolled participants that actively participate in the intervention, we obtained no assessment data from the children themselves.\n\nT1 and T2 questionnaires measure primary parents' parenting practices, self-efficacy, and stress; children's behavior, emotional adjustment, and sleep problems; and the parent-child relationship. The T2 questionnaire also contains measures of parent satisfaction, acceptability, and usability of the Talk Parenting skill, as well as any difficulties experienced, or problems made worse. Demographics are collected at T1. T1 and T2 questionnaires are administered via Qualtrics, an online assessment tool. Project staff follow-up with parents as needed to encourage questionnaire completion in a timely manner. Parents are paid $20 per assessment.\n\nFamilies are provided an Echo Dot device with the Talk Parenting skill already enabled using a research Amazon account created for each family. The Echo Dot devices are paired with portable auxiliary battery packs to enable mobile use within the home, so that the device can be carried from room to room during execution of the bedtime routine. The devices are preconfigured by project staff onto research Amazon accounts. All families are provided a pre-configured wifi adaptor that creates a wifi network specific for the Echo Dot device to connect to. After the baseline assessment (T1), primary parents are mailed their Echo Dot device, portable auxiliary battery pack, wifi adaptor, and set-up instructions; staff provide follow-up phone support as needed. Usage data show whether families have used the device; project staff contact the parents to assist set up if parents have not enabled/used the device within 2 weeks. To ensure exposure to Talk Parenting, parents are asked to engage with the skill at least twice per week (or at least eight times); project staff prompt parents two to three times (via text, email, or phone, depending on parents' preference) during the 4-week period to encourage usage and provide technical support as needed.\n\nAt the end of the study, families are asked to return the wifi adaptor to the project offices; families are free to keep the Echo Dot device and auxiliary battery pack."

Then parents are asked to rate how confident they are in doing 12 of these target parenting practices, on a 10-point scale (1=Not at all confident; 10=Highly confident); average scores range from 1 to 10, higher scores indicating better outcomes. Finally, 3 items ask parents for their satisfaction with how child's bedtime is going, on a 10-point scale (0=Not at all satisfied; 10=Very satisfied); average scores range from 1 to 10, higher scores indicating better outcomes.",

The CPRS-SF is comprised of 15 parent-report items that ask the parent for their assessment of the child-parent relationship, the child's emotional stance toward the parent, and the parent's feelings toward the child. Two subscales are derived: Conflicts and Positive Aspects/Closeness. The Conflicts subscale is measured by 7 items on a 5-point scale (1=Definitely does not apply; 5=Definitely applies); average scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. The Closeness subscale is measured with 7 items on the same 5-point scale; average scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better outcomes.

The CPRS-SF is comprised of 15 parent-report items that ask the parent for their assessment of the child-parent relationship, the child's emotional stance toward the parent, and the parent's feelings toward the child. Two subscales are derived: Conflicts and Positive Aspects/Closeness. The Conflicts subscale is measured by 7 items on a 5-point scale (1=Definitely does not apply; 5=Definitely applies); average scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. The Closeness subscale is measured with 7 items on the same 5-point scale; average scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better outcomes. The CPRS-SF has been validated with parents of preschoolers and first graders and shows good internal consistency.",

Before randomization, participants who were born female must be either: a) not of childbearing potential; b) of childbearing potential and practicing a highly effective method of contraception and agreeing to remain on such a method of contraception from signing the informed consent until 3 months after the last dose of study vaccine. Use of hormonal contraception should start at least 28 days before the first administration of study vaccine. Highly effective methods for this study include: hormonal contraception, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, vasectomized partner (the vasectomized partner should be the sole partner for that participant), and sexual abstinence\n* All female participants of childbearing potential must: a) have a negative highly sensitive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test at screening; b) have a negative urine beta-hCG pregnancy test immediately prior to each study vaccine administration\n* Must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the results of the laboratory screening tests are outside the laboratory normal reference ranges and additionally within the limits of toxicity Grade 2 according to the US FDA toxicity scale the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant and appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindication to IM injections and blood draws, example, bleeding disorders\n* Clinically significant acute illness (this does not include minor illnesses such as diarrhea or mild upper respiratory tract infection) or temperature greater than or equal to (\\>=) 38.0 degree Celsius (100.4 degree Fahrenheit) within 24 hours prior to the planned first dose of study vaccine; randomization at a later date is permitted at the discretion of the investigator and after consultation with the sponsor\n* History of severe allergic reaction (for example, anaphylaxis) or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine excipients (specifically the excipients of the study vaccine\\[s\\])\n* Abnormal function of the immune system resulting from: a) clinical conditions (example, autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency) or their treatments expected to have an impact on the immune response elicited by the study vaccine; b) chronic or recurrent use of systemic corticosteroids within 2 months before administration of study vaccine and during the study; c) administration of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy expected to have an impact on the immune response elicited by the study vaccine within 6 months before administration of study vaccine and during the study\n* History of acute polyneuropathy (example, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) or chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy\n* Received treatment with immunoglobulins (including monoclonal antibodies) expected to impact the vaccine-induced immune response in the 2 months or blood products in the 3 months before the planned administration of the first dose of study vaccine or has any plans to receive such treatment during the study.\n* Received an investigational drug or used an invasive investigational medical device within 30 days or received an investigational vaccine within 6 months before the planned administration of the first dose of study vaccine, or received an investigational biological product within 3 months or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before the planned study intervention, or is currently enrolled or plans to participate in another investigational study or observational clinical study during the course of this study\n* Pregnant, or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this study or within 3 months after the last dose of study vaccine. Oocyte donation is prohibited while enrolled in this study\n* Received or plans to receive: licensed live attenuated vaccines - within 28 days before or after planned administration of the first or subsequent study vaccination\\[s\\]; other licensed (not live) vaccines (not including seasonal influenza vaccines) - within 14 days before or after planned administration of the first or subsequent study vaccination\\[s\\]; seasonal influenza vaccines - within 4 months before planned administration of the first study vaccination until the end of the study (that is, any individual who requires a seasonal influenza vaccination for occupational or other reasons will be excluded)\n* Has received a pandemic influenza vaccine (other than Hemagglutinin Type 1 and Neuraminidase Type 1 \\[H1N1\\]) in a previous pandemic influenza vaccine study at any time prior to randomization",

                    "detailedDescription": "1. Patient characteristics such as age, (premorbid) modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and stroke characteristics such as stroke severity (NIHSS) will be documented. There will be screened for preexisting cognitive decline (by using a Dutch shortened and validated version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Clinical assessments such as NIHSS and mRS will be repeated after 3 and 12 months, as part of regular care. Comorbid conditions will be documented during the whole duration of the study.\n2. Previous or concomitant use of drugs will be registered, in particular those known to affect cognitive function, such as anticholinergic drugs, analgo-sedatives or benzodiazepines.\n3. Delirium assessment during hospitalization: delirium assessment will be performed twice a day, at the beginning and ending of each day shift with a minimal interval of 5 hours between the two evaluations each day, during the first 72 hours after ischemic stroke onset. The length of the screening period is based on the results of a prospective observational study that showed that almost all of PSD cases occurred within 72 hours (98%). If a patient develops delirium during the first 72 hours after stroke onset, delirium monitoring will be continued until 4 negative screening tests are obtained (because of possible fluctuations of delirium signs) or until the end of the hospitalization. Delirium assessments will be performed by a trained nurse using the 4 'A's Test (4AT) and the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). The RASS will be used to determine the type of delirium, with negative RASS scores indicating hypoactive delirium and a positive RASS score indicating hyperactive delirium.\n4. EEG recordings will be performed by a trained neurophysiology nurse, using 21 electrodes placed according to the 10-20 system, with 10 minutes eyes open and 10 minutes eyes closed, within one hour of the clinical evaluation during the hospitalization. The first EEG will be routinely recorded during the first 24 hours after stroke onset. A second EEG will be only be recorded in patients who develop PSD between 24 and 72 hours after stroke onset. EEG's recorded during hospitalization are considered standard of care. EEG recording will be repeated at 12 months.\n5. MRI of the brain will be performed during hospitalization (=standard of care) and 12 months after stroke onset. Standard acute stroke imaging will involve a 3-T MR scanner with sagittal 3DFLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) sequence, T2 sequence fossa posterior with a slice thickness of 2mm, axial diffusion sequence (slice thickness 4mm), 3D-SWI (susceptibility weighted imaging) sequence (slice thickness 2mm) and 3D-QALAS sequence. Manual segmentation of the acute ischemic lesion will be performed on MRI scans of the brain, performed during hospitalization for IS. Patients without visible acute ischemic lesions on MRI will be excluded. Acute ischemic stroke lesions (AIL) are defined by the presence of a hyperintense MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion with corresponding hypointensity in apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). The DWI and ADC images may also help to discriminate between new ischemic lesions and pre-existent white matter hyperintensities. Prior to performing the segmentations for the current study, the reviewer will delineate AIL on 10 scans twice with an interval of 1 month, with the aim to optimize intraobserver agreement. Visual rating of white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas scale) and cerebral atrophy (global cortical atrophy (GCA) scale) as markers of brain frailty.\n6. Cognitive and mood assessment: neuropsychological assessment will take place at 3 months and 12 months after the IS. A trained nurse will administer the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA, Dutch or French version) at these time intervals. She will be blinded for the initial occurrence of delirium. Depression screening will be performed at the same time intervals by using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (in order to be able to compare with previously performed delirium studies)."

The parent RCT (Vitamin D to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging Early Treatment \\[VIOLET\\], NCT03096314) is part of the Clinical Trials Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) sponsored by the NHLBI. The VIOLET trial completed enrollment in July 2018 with 1,360 randomized to either high dose, enteral Vitamin D3 or placebo.\n\nThis ancillary study will provide additional funding to perform comprehensive neuropsychological (cognitive) evaluations, which were not part of the parent trial. These neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted 12 (+/- 4) months after randomization among a subset of 140 survivors enrolled in VIOLET. This ancillary study will conducted in 7 (out of 42) sites."

Escalation will be based on a modified toxicity probability interval design \\[mTPI-2\\] until MTD is identified or the pre-specified rules are met.\n\nA lead-in dosimetry sub-study will be conducted during the dose escalation period in which all subjects in the first two dose cohorts will undergo dosimetric evaluation prior to receiving the therapeutic agent."
