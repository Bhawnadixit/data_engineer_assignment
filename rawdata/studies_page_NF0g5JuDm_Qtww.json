The planned design is to enroll 26 participants in each of the 3 arms: the abrocitinib arm, the ritlecitinib arm, and the shared placebo arm. Within the shared placebo arm, participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive placebo matched to abrocitinib or placebo matched to ritlecitinib. Randomization will be stratified by the following two age categories: 12-17 years old, and 18 years or above. Within each stratum, participants will be randomized to either the abrocitinib arm, ritlecitinib arm, or the shared placebo arm using random block sizes. The total number of enrolled participants from the older age stratum (18 years or above) will be limited to 33 to replicate the age distribution in previous new-onset trials. Participants will receive 12 months of active treatment with abrocitinib, ritlecitinib, or placebo then enter a follow-up period of up to 12 months.",

Oral health is considered a prominent factor that contributes to quality of life.\n\nTherefore, this study aim at assessing the effect of message framing on enhancing oral health practices in a group of refugees in Alexandria, Egypt. A three-arm cluster randomized controlled clinical trial will compare a gain-framed mobile text messages group, a loss-framed mobile text messages group, and a control group. The primary outcome is the improvement in oral health practices measured by changes in dental plaque and secondary outcome is to assess change in oral health-related quality of life. In addition, oral health knowledge, attitudes, and practices of refugees will be assessed."

                    "detailedDescription": "Postmenopausal bone loss is a primary contributor to osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures in adult women in menopause transition. By following women over this period, studies have documented distinct patterns of a decrease in estrogen, a natural antioxidant, simultaneously with adverse alterations in body fat distribution, lipids and lipoproteins, and measures of vascular health, which can increase a woman's risk of developing CVD. Overall goal of this project is to evaluate the effects of blackcurrant (BC) supplementation on changes in gut microbiome, bone mass, and CVD risk factors in adult women. For this purpose, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with BC supplementation for 6 months in peri- and early postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be whole-body bone mineral density (BMD); secondary endpoints will be gut microbiota composition. To delineate the underlying mechanisms of the action, changes in biomarkers for bone metabolism, bone-related immune and endocrine systemic biomarkers, and CVD risk factors by BC supplementation will be measured in plasma and peripheral blood derived mononuclear cells.\n\nThe specific objectives of the study are to investigate the effects of BC extract on: 1) bone mass and bone remodeling markers; 2) changes in the gut microbiota abundance and composition, immune and endocrine biomarkers, and CVD risk factors and their relationships with changes in bone mass.\n\nThe proposed study will provide novel insight into whether and how BC consumption reduces the risk of postmenopausal bone loss and CVD in adult women and will improve understanding of the clinical roles of gut microbiome in postmenopausal bone loss. Findings from this study will help increase awareness of the bone and heart health promoting effect of BC and motivate increased production of BC and other berry products in response to the increasing consumer demand."

The main question it aims to answer whether vitamin D3 supplementation can reduce depressive symptoms.\n\nParticipants in the intervention group will receive vitamin D3 capsules and mental health education. The control group will receive vitamin D3 placebo and mental health education.\n\nResearchers will compare the change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post-intervention at 12 weeks between the intervention and control groups.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine whether vitamin D3 supplementation can improve depressive symptoms. A total of 310 participants will be recruited from two middle schools. Inclusion criteria are grades 7th and 8th students whose caregivers signed informed consents, self-reported mild and moderate depressive symptoms with scores of BDI-II\\>13, and serum 25(OH)D concentration of 12-20 ng/mL. Exclusion criteria are the use of anti-psychotic treatments or interventions in the past 3 months; serious health conditions (e.g., major psychiatric disorders, serious infectious diseases, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, and hepatic or renal diseases); the use of vitamin D supplements in the past 3 months; self-reported suicidal plans/attempts in the past 3 months; intellectual disability. Participants will be randomly assigned into a supplementation or placebo group. Supplementation arm will receive oral dose 2000 IU vitamin D3 per day for 6 weeks and followed by 800 IU per day for 6 weeks; placebo arm will receive placebo every day for 12 weeks. Both of these two groups will receive additional mental health education. For the first 6 weeks, vitamin D or placebo will be administrated every two weeks. For the next 6 weeks, vitamin D or placebo will be administrated every three weeks. The primary outcome of this study is to compare the change of depressive symptoms between supplementation or placebo group from pre- to post-intervention at 12 weeks."

The 800nm Diode Laser treatment will be applied to the other axilla. Treatment allocation will be randomized for each participant. Participants will undergo monthly sessions for four months, totaling four treatments. Follow-up assessments will occur 30 days and 6 months after the final session.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized controlled trial of hair removal in axilla for women, being intense pulsed light compared to diode laser.\n\nThe session frequency will be once a month for 4 months, totaling 4 treatments. There will be a follow-up at 30 days and 6 months after the end of the treatment.\n\nAfter the evaluations and photographs, the armpits will be cleaned with 0.5% alcoholic chlorhexidine and will be shaved with a disposable razor blade. Neutral water-based gel will be applied to the region to receive the treatment. Patients will be instructed not to perform any trichotomy procedures in the region during the research period.\n\nThe treatment technique will be punctual where the applicator will be kept in full contact with the skin at 90\u00b0 and moved to the next point after deposition of energy over the entire treatment area until the defined energy is delivered. The applicator tip will be cooled as much as the equipment allows."

Specifically, to learn what stakeholders (i.e., patients, parents, and doctors) believe to be the \"right\" content, timing, and delivery of this important information.\n\nSpecific Aim 1\n\n* To define key stakeholder preferences and recommendations for timing, content, and delivery of prognostic communication across the advancing illness course and bereavement.\n\nSpecific Aim 2\n\n* To engage stakeholders in the design of a patient/parent centered RIGHTime framework and communication intervention to promote individualized, timely prognostic disclosure.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This study will have two phases.\n\nPhase 1:\n\nInvestigators will define key stakeholder preferences and recommendations for timing, content, and delivery of prognostic communication across the advancing illness course and bereavement. Eligible parents and patients will participate in semi-structured interviews on prognostic communication preferences, stratified by cohort: poor-prognosis diagnosis, advancing disease, phase I/II trial enrollment, and bereavement; eligible oncologists will complete interviews on prognostic disclosure preferences. Participants will participate in a single interview that will last anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes.The interview will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Participant demographic and social determinants of health information will be collected.\n\nPhase 2:\n\nInvestigators will partner with a smaller group of stakeholders (parents, patients, and oncologist) from phase 1 to develop a clinical communication guide to help improve communication between patients, families, and cancer doctors. The panel will meet across 4 sessions to develop a conceptual framework that explains the interconnecting variables influencing stakeholder preferences and to design a prognostic communication intervention (i.e., a RIGHTime communication guide) that encourages oncologists to provide individualized, timely prognostic disclosure."
