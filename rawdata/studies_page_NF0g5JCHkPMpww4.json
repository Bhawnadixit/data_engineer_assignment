The CivaSheet device in this study is already approved by the FDA and is not an experimental device. This study will allow us to determine how feasible it is to implant the CivaSheet into patients undergoing surgery for abdominal and pelvic tumors, and assess any possible side effects of the device. This study, if successful, may allow us to offer the CivaSheet more widely as treatment option to future patients."

Amino acids, such as levocarnitine, may work in normalizing liver enzyme levels due to treatment. Vitamin B complex is a dietary supplement that may be used for patients with nutritional deficiencies. Giving levocarnitine and vitamin B complex may work better in treating hyperbilirubinemia in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

To evaluate the efficacy of levocarnitine in combination with vitamin B complex in treating PEG-asparaginase (PEG) or inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) induced hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin \\[Tbili\\] \\> 3 x upper limit of normal \\[ULN\\]) in patients (pts) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate chemotherapy dose intensity in patients treated with PEG-asparaginase or inotuzumab ozogamicin.\n\nII. To characterize the safety, tolerability, and adverse event profile of levocarnitine and vitamin B for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nPatients receive levocarnitine intravenously (IV) over 2-3 minutes every 6 hours up to 4 times a day (inpatient) or orally (PO) three times a day (TID) (outpatient). Patients also receive vitamin B complex PO twice daily (BID). Treatment continues for up to 30 days after the last dose of either PEG-asparaginase or inotuzumab, or until Tbili of \u2264 1.5 x ULN or at least a 50% reduction in peak Tbili is achieved.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."

Spinal cord stimulation has been shown to improve chronic pain, improve quality of life, and reduce disability. Unfortunately, spinal cord stimulation has a high trial failure rate and a high long-term failure rate. This study consists of a prospective cohort of patients clinically scheduled to undergo spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic back pain or radiculopathy. Participants will undergo a structured optimization evaluating existing types of stimulation (tonic, burst, and multistim). Each participant will try out all types of available stimulation but be blinded to the type. Over the course of four months, each participant will evaluate each type of stimulation by reporting daily pain scores. Thompson sampling will be used to identify which setting produces the biggest improvement in pain and recommend it for future use. Participants will follow up routinely to collect laboratory, behavioral, and survey responses to test for the feasibility of obtaining data explaining pain phenotype."

Enrollment will end at the latest within 52 weeks from Day 1 of the study, regardless of the number of patients actually recruited. After completion of the treatment phase/end of treatment (EOT), eligible patients will enter a 4-week safety follow up (FU) phase. Patients who continue to be on treatment beyond 52 weeks, based on the investigator's judgment will not be included in the 4-week safety FU phase."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of prophylactic oral antibiotics on preventing cholangitis in biliary atresia (BA) patients after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) by comparing the cholangitis rate in BA patients who received prophylactic oral antibiotics and those who did not. The patients were followed up for 2 years after KP.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Biliary atresia (BA) is a devastating inflammatory obstructive neonatal disease affecting intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) is the mainstay of treatment for BA. Cholangitis is a common complication after KP, with an overall incidence of 22-93%, and an incidence of 30-70% within 6 months after KP. The mechanism of cholangitis may be intestinal bacteria ascending into the intrahepatic biliary system or bacterial colonization, etc. Common causative organisms include Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus, and Salmonella typhi. There is some controversy about prophylactic antibiotics after KP, and the type, dosage and course of antibiotics in medical institutions around the world vary greatly. After years of improvement, although the postoperative management and short-term prognosis of BA have improved, the overall incidence of cholangitis has not changed much. High-quality evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis after KP remains lacking. It still remains unknown that whether long-term prophylactic oral antibiotics could benefit the patients. Long-term use of antibiotics may not only increase the burden of liver dysfunction in patients, but also lead to antibiotic resistance, intestinal flora disturbance, and increase the risk of allergies and autoimmune diseases. It is of great significance to use evidence-based medicine to find a relatively reasonable cholangitis prevention program.\n\nThis study is non-inferiority trial design. This study aimed to investigate the effect of prophylactic oral antibiotics on preventing cholangitis by comparing the cholangitis rate in BA patients who received prophylactic oral antibiotics after KP and those who did not. Patients diagnosed with type III BA and receiving KP at Children's Hospital of Fudan University will be assigned to 2 groups. Both groups received the same basic treatment, then the patients in the antibiotics group received prophylactic oral antibiotics until the 6th month after KP, while the non-antibiotics group no longer used prophylactic antibiotics until cholangitis occurred.

                    "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests how well surgical resection after chemotherapy given before surgery to make the tumor smaller (neoadjuvant) works to treat pancreatic cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). In general, surgery is considered the most effective treatment for pancreatic cancer, especially when the cancer is localized and has not spread to other organs. However, most patients with pancreatic cancer are not candidates for surgical removal because the cancer has grown into or close to nearby arteries, veins, or organs and there is a concern of damaging these nearby structures. Researchers want to find out if surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be done safely to completely remove the tumor in patients with locally advanced and unresectable pancreatic cancer.",

To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy.\n\nIII. To assess if mutations on next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing and the change in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) pre- and post-operative is predictive of DFS or OS in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nIV. To evaluate the rate of unresectability in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy.\n\nV. To evaluate pathologic tumor response and rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nVI. To evaluate correlation between R0 resection rate and pathologic treatment response and survival outcomes.\n\nVII. To evaluate number of cycles of perioperative chemotherapy received in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nVIII. To evaluate the adverse event profile in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nIX. To evaluate the physical functioning, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea, as measured with the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nX. To evaluate the average operative time in minutes in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nXI. To evaluate the estimated blood loss (mL) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nXII. To assess the length of hospital, stay in for patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nXIII. To evaluate the incidence of thrombosis in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo laparoscopy followed by surgical resection with pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy at the discretion of the surgeon within 2-8 weeks following completion of standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) and blood sample collection throughout the study and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during screening. Patients also undergo tissue collection at time of surgical resection on study.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months until 2 years."

                    "detailedDescription": "Bedside blind insertion is the most common method for gastric tube indwelling in clinical practice. The key problem is that the position of the tube cannot be accurately determined in real time.Bedside ultrasound has become a common medical technology, and resources are easy to obtain. Therefore, bedside ultrasound has the advantages of fast, accurate, real-time repeatable, and non-invasive in determining the position of the end of the indwelling gastric tube.The purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy of bedside ultrasound in guiding gastric tube placement and judging the position of the end of the tube in children with CHD aged 0-6 years. To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of bedside ultrasound guided gastric tube placement during perioperative period in children with congenital heart disease (CHD), this study plans to procedure the prospective randomized controlled study."

The main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\nIs PEP safe and tolerable when injected into the hypodermis of healthy adults?\n\nSubjects will serve as their own control and researchers will compare PEP to Control to see if PEP is safe.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, non-randomized, within-subject, controlled, single center, open-label study. Up to 9 healthy adult participants with planned elective body reduction surgery to remove excess skin on the abdomen in \u2265 12 to \u2264 18 weeks will be enrolled and injected with a single dose of PEP Drug Product reconstituted in Lactated Ringers (USP) solution in a defined area of the abdominal hypodermis. Similar tissue from the participant's contralateral side of the abdomen will serve as the control. Excised tissue will be harvested and analyzed for key biological markers for skin quality and senescence such as collagen and elastin. The primary goal of this investigator-initiated study is to determine safety of subcutaneous PEP Drug Product when reconstituted in Lactated Ringers solution. Safety data will be collected with frequent monitoring for adverse events, laboratory testing, vital signs, and ECGs.\n\nNote: The decision to undergo abdominoplasty will be made outside of this study and data/safety in the plastic surgery procedure for abdominoplasty, other than informed consent, will not be a collected as a part of this study."

                    "briefSummary": "Heart failure (HF) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients are frequently not administered renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) therapies at recommended doses due to hyperkalaemia, despite proven mortality and morbidity benefits. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a nonabsorbed potassium binder proven to lower serum potassium (S-K) and maintain normokalaemia. The purpose is to assess if a treatment regimen containing SZC will allow RAASi therapies to be optimized to target doses in patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease and elevated serum potassium or at risk of developing elevated serum potassium.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized clinical trial, multicentre, parallel group, open label, to evaluate the use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) to optimize RAASi therapy in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease, through up-titration of ACEi, ARB, ARNI or MRA therapy according to clinical guidelines (1), without inducing clinically significant hyperkalemia. Eligible subjects will have been admitted to hospital because of an HF (NYHA I- III) decompensation, will have required intravenous diuretics and will have had mild hyperkalaemic values that needed stabilization or be at risk of developing hyperkalaemia. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive SZC or none (standard of care treatment without potassium binders) for 3 months while optimizing RAASi therapies according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines."
