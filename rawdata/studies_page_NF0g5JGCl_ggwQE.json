The aim of the project is to construct the Chinese neonatal genome database, establish the genetic testing standard of neonatal genetic diseases, and promote the industrialization of neonatal genetic disease gene testing, improve the training system for genetic counseling.",
                    "detailedDescription": "There are about 900,000 new cases of birth defects in China every year. There are a large number of hereditary diseases, such as primary immune deficiency diseases, genetic metabolic diseases and multiple malformation syndrome, etc. It is important to identify and diagnose these diseases early in life, which can optimize the treatment strategy, improve the quality of life, and achieve the purpose of accurate treatment. To improve the level of diagnosis and prevention of genetic diseases in children is conducive to the birth and education of newborn in our country. The China Neonatal Genome Project is an important part of the China Human single Target Genome Project. The investigators plan to complete genetic testing of 100,000 newborns within 5 years, establish genetic testing standards for genetic diseases of newborns, and promote precise intervention for birth defects. The Genetic Counseling Branch of China Genetics Society, the Pediatrics Hospital affiliated to Fudan University and hundreds of hospitals in China jointly launched the Chinese newborn Genome Project in Shanghai, China. The project will carry out the genetic testing of 100000 neonates in the next 5 years. The study physician and genetic counselor will provide the consultation to families utilizing all available medical information. In the sequencing analysis of the study, this will include the medical history, physical exam, family history, standard newborn screening report. The aim of the project is to construct the Chinese neonatal genome database, establish the genetic testing standard of neonatal genetic diseases, and promote the industrialization of neonatal genetic disease gene testing, improve the training system for genetic counseling."

                    "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have diabetic macular edema.\n\nDiabetic macular edema (DME) is a diabetes-related eye disorder. In DME, the macula, which is the central part of the retina at the back of the eye, swells up resulting in vision problems. This happens due to leakage of fluid from damaged blood vessels.\n\nThe study treatment, 8 milligram (mg) aflibercept is injected into the eye. It works by blocking a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which causes abnormal growth and leakage of blood vessels at the back of the eye.\n\nA lower dose of aflibercept (2 mg) is already approved for the treatment of DME. Based on the findings of another study, the higher dose of aflibercept (8 mg) is expected to reduce the frequency of injections required for treating DME while being equally safe and working as well as the lower dose. The higher dose could make it easier to treat DME and improve quality of life for people with DME.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn if high-dose (8 mg) aflibercept given every 16 weeks works as well as low-dose (2 mg) aflibercept given every 8 weeks in Chinese participants.\n\nFor this, the researchers will compare the change in participants' 'best corrected visual acuity' (BCVA) after 48 weeks of starting the treatment. BCVA is the clearest vision a participant can have with the help of corrective lenses, such as glasses. It will be measured by the number of letters the participant can read on an eye chart. This is known as their Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter score.\n\nParticipants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of two treatment groups to receive study treatment as an injection into the eye up to Week 56:\n\n* 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks after receiving 5 initial monthly doses\n* 8 mg aflibercept every 16 weeks after receiving 3 initial monthly doses\n\nEach participant will be in the study for around 63 weeks with up to 18 visits to the study site. This includes:\n\n* one visit up to 21 days before the treatment starts during which the doctors will confirm that the participant can take part in the study\n* 16 visits during which the treatment will be given. Most of these visits will have a gap of 4 weeks except for one visit that will happen a few days after the previous visit\n* one visit 4 weeks after the treatment ends\n\nDuring the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* check the participants' vision and their overall eye health using different eye tests\n* check participants' health by performing tests such as blood and urine tests\n* ask the participants questions about the disease and study treatment and how these impact their quality of life\n* ask the participants what adverse events they are having An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective of whether they think they are related to the study treatment.\n\nAccess to study treatment after the end of this study is not planned. Participants can switch to available approved treatments for DME.",
                    "detailedDescription": "EYLEA (aflibercept 40 mg/mL solution for injection) at a dosage level of 2 mg administered intravitreally (IVT) is approved in over 100 countries for the treatment of DME. Despite the proven efficacy and safety of EYLEA in patients with DME, there remains an unmet need for alternative therapies that can decrease the burden of DME treatment via a reduction in the required frequency of IVT injections, while improving visual and anatomic outcomes. The overall one and two year results of PHOTON, a global phase 2/3 trial evaluating high dose (HD or 8 mg) aflibercept in participants with center-involved diabetic macular edema (DME), demonstrate the benefit of HD aflibercept for reducing the frequency of injections required for the treatment of DME while providing visual and anatomic outcomes non-inferior to and a safety profile indistinguishable from EYLEA, 2 mg aflibercept, the established standard of care for the treatment of DME. The observed reduction in the number of HD aflibercept injections required for the treatment of DME over 2 years in PHOTON is expected to translate into the benefit of reducing the burden of treatment and, thereby improving the quality of life for DME patients, their caregivers and health care providers. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of HD aflibercept in Chinese participants with DME over 60 weeks with the primary objective of achieving non-inferior best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with an extended dosing interval (every 16 weeks after 3 initial monthly injections) vs. 2 mg aflibercept (every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly injections) similar to the results obtained in PHOTON. This study is designed to support the registration of HD aflibercept for the treatment of DME in China.\n\nPrimary Objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine if treatment with HD aflibercept at intervals of 16 weeks provides non-inferior best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks in Chinese participants\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To determine the effect of HD aflibercept vs. 2 mg aflibercept on anatomic and other visual measures of response;\n* To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HD aflibercept in Chinese participants.\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n* Change from baseline in BCVA by ETDRS letter score at Week 48\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* Change from baseline in BCVA by ETDRS letter score at Week 60\n* Participants gaining \u226515 letters at Week 48 and Week 60\n* Participants achieving an ETDRS letter score of at least 69 (approximate 20/40 Snellen equivalent) at Week 48\n* Participants with no IRF and/or no SRF in the center subfield at Week 48\n* Change from baseline in central subfield thickness (CST) at Week 48\n* Change from baseline in leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA) at Week 48\n* Change from baseline in National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) total score at Week 48\n* Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) through Weeks 48 and 60\n* Participants developing a treatment-emergent ADA response or Nabs to aflibercept through EOS at Week 60\n* Systemic exposure to aflibercept as assessed by plasma concentrations of free, adjusted bound, and total aflibercept from baseline through Week 48 This study is a phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study in Chinese participants with DME involving the center of the macula to investigate the efficacy and safety of HD aflibercept versus 2 mg aflibercept.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine if treatment with HD aflibercept at 16 week intervals provides non-inferior BCVA compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks in Chinese participants.\n\n322 eligible participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following 2 treatment groups:\n\n1. 2q8: 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly doses (n=161) and\n2. HDq16: HD aflibercept every 16 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (n=161). The study consists of a screening period, a treatment period, and an end of study (EOS) visit at Week 60. The study duration for a participant is approximately 63 weeks. The EOS is defined as the last visit of the last participant. No study treatment will be administered at the EOS visit at Week 60.\n\nHD aflibercept is the sponsor's study intervention under investigation.

                    "detailedDescription": "While you are taking part in this study, participants will be asked to attend approximately two visits with the researchers or study staff. For research purposes, one visit is the surgical appointment and a postoperative visit at six months, these will likely be scheduled at standard of care visits.\n\nIf the participant elects a dental implant for tooth replacement, your sinus grafting will be performed, and the dental implant will be placed on the same appointment.\n\nStudy Procedures - as a participant in this research, you will undergo the following procedures:\n\n1. Immediately upon completion of your sinus grafting and dental implant placement a three-dimensional x-ray will be taken in the Graduate Periodontics clinic.\n2. At six months following your dental implant placement an additional three-dimensional x-ray will be taken in the Graduate Periodontics clinic."

                    "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced solid tumors.\n\nAdvanced solid tumors are types of cancer that may have spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, and/or to distant parts of the body and that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently available treatments. This study focuses on certain types of skin cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, and lung cancer.\n\nThe study treatment BAY2965501 is currently under development as monotherapy or in combination with a drug named pembrolizumab for the treatment of people with advanced solid tumors.\n\nBAY2965501 blocks an enzyme in T-cells to activate them. T-cells are a type of immune cell that are known to have an anti-cancer effect and BAY2965501 is a potential new immunotherapy.\n\nThe main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn:\n\n* how safe different doses of BAY2965501 are when given as a single drug or in combination,\n* the degree to which medical problems caused by BAY2965501 when given as a single drug or in combination, can be tolerated (also called tolerability),\n* what maximum amount can be given as a single drug or in combination, and\n* how it moves into, through and out of the body as a single drug or in combination.\n\nTo answer this, researchers will look at:\n\n* the number and severity of medical problems participants have after taking BAY2965501 as a single drug or in combination for each dose level. These medical problems are also referred to as adverse events.\n* the (average) total level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called AUC) after intake of single and multiple doses\n* the (average) highest level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called Cmax) after intake of single and multiple doses Doctors keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study, even if they do not think the medical problem might be related to the study treatment.\n\nIn addition, the researchers want to know if and how the participants' tumors change after taking BAY2965501.\n\nThe study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the most appropriate dose that can be given in the second part. For this, participants will be assigned to receive one of the planned doses and schedules of BAY2965501 as single drug or participants will be assigned to one of the increasing doses of BAY2965501 in combination with 200mg pembrolizumab. All participants will take BAY2965501 by mouth. Additionally, in the combination group, pembrozilumab will be given.\n\nIn the second part, called dose expansion, all participants in the single drug group will receive up to 2 of the most appropriate doses of BAY2965501 from the 1st part as tablet by mouth. The participants in the combination group will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY2965501 from the first part.\n\nParticipants in both parts of the study, will take the study treatment until the tumor gets worse (also known as 'disease progression'), or until the participants have medical problems. In general, the study treatment is planned for a maximum of 35 cycles.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for several months, including a screening phase of up to 28 days, few months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow up phase after the end of treatment. The following approximate numbers of visits to the study site are planned: two during the screening phase, six in the first treatment month, one to three per month in the following periods.\n\nParticipants in part two will be assigned to one of 3 groups depending on cancer characteristics.\n\nStudy procedures described below may vary between these groups.\n\nDuring the study, the study team will:\n\n* take blood and urine samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature\n* examine heart health using ECG (electrocardiogram)\n* check if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and, if needed, bone scan\n* take tumor samples (if required)\n\nThe treatment period ends with a visit no later than 7 days after the last BAY2965501 dose in the single drug and combination group. About 30 and 90 days after the last dose and every 12 weeks thereafter, the study team will check the participants' health and any changes in cancer. This follow-up period ends with worsening of the cancer, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or until the participant leaves the study. In addition, the study doctors and their team will contact the participant every 12 weeks to learn about the participant's survival. This ends no later than 12 months after the last participant started treatment or by the end of the study, whichever comes first."

                    "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to observe the performance of an implant system with a new surface (EK III NH dental implants) over a period of two years. The implants will be placed in the upper and lower jaws of patients with missing teeth and immediately given a temporary restoration. The investigators will document the performance of the implants through regular dental check-ups and X-rays.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Treating patients with missing teeth using dental implants is now a common and reliable approach in modern dentistry. Significant improvement has been made in implant shape design, implant surface optimization and surgical techniques to ensure predictable bonding between the titanium implants and bone (osseointegration). Modern implants are designed to be stable both immediately after placement (primary stability) and over time as they bond with the bone (secondary stability). Factors such as the quality and quantity of the patients' bone, the design of the implant, and the surgical technique used can all affect primary stability. The implant's secondary stability is affected by many of these same factors but has also been demonstrated to be influenced by other patient-related factors, including wound site blood supply, as well as the surface of the implants. Various surface treatments, like titanium plasma spraying, acid etching, hydroxyapatite coating, and sandblasting, have been developed to improve this bond (secondary stability). For instance, porous coatings can help by allowing the bone to grow into the implant, while hydroxyapatite coatings are biocompatible and encourage bone formation. Research has shown that different surface treatments can lead to different cellular responses, affecting how bone cells (osteoblasts) behave and develop around the implant.\n\nIn clinical practice, several methods are used to measure how stable an implant is immediately after placement, known as primary stability. These methods include measuring the insertion torque and using resonance frequency analysis (RFA). To assess secondary stability, or osseointegration, which refers to the long-term bonding of the implant to the bone, various techniques are used. These include RFA, mechanical disruption testing, and histomorphometric analysis. Additionally, changes in the bone level around the implant are commonly observed through X-rays as a non-invasive way to monitor the long-term success of dental implants. Human histological evidence of successfully osseointegrated implants is extremely rare in the literature because there are few opportunities to retrieve implants in humans.\n\nHiossen is a leading and rapidly growing implant manufacturer, with its systems used in over 70 countries. Recently, the company launched a new implant system called EK III NH. This system features a sand-blasted and acid-etched (SA) surface with a nano-hydroxyapatite (NH) coating. This special surface allows for faster bone healing and reduces the time before the implant can be loaded compared to other types of implant surfaces. The company's internal studies have shown that this surface treatment creates a very thin coating layer on the implant that is hydrophilic, meaning it attracts water, which improves the bonding process with 30% higher osseointegration than conventional SA surfaces. In addition, the new EK III NH system includes design improvements compared to the current ET SA implant system by the same company. New features include a buttress thread, 0.9 mm pitch, reverse helical cutting edge, and an improved internal hex connection, making the system easier to achieve good mechanical bonding immediately (primary stability) and easier to restore.\n\nThe investigators propose conducting a short-term clinical study to examine how well the bone around the EK III NH implants is maintained when they are immediately restored with a temporary crown. This study aims to assess the benefits of using the EK III NH implants in dental treatments."

                    "briefSummary": "Finerenone works by blocking a group of proteins, called mineralocorticoid receptor. An increased stimulation of mineralocorticoid receptor is known to trigger injury and inflammation in the kidney and is therefore thought to play a role in CKD.\n\nEmpagliflozin lowers blood sugar levels by increasing the excretion of glucose from the blood into the urine.\n\nIn this study, the researchers want to learn how well the combination of finerenone and empagliflozin helps to slow down the worsening of the participants' kidney function compared to either treatment alone. For this, the level of protein in the urine will be measured. The investigators also want to know how safe the combination is compared to either treatment alone.\n\nDepending on the treatment group, the participants will either take the combination of finerenone and empagliflozin, or finerenone together with a placebo, or empagliflozin together with a placebo, once a day as tablets by mouth. A placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any medicine in it. Importantly, the participants will also continue to take their other current medicine for CKD and T2D.\n\nThe participants will be in the study for up to 7.5 months and will take the study treatments for 6 months. During the study, participants will visit the study site 7 times.\n\nThe study team will:\n\n* collect blood and urine samples\n* check the participants' vital signs\n* do a physical examination including height and weight\n* check the participants' heart health by using an electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* monitor the participants' blood pressure\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they may be having An adverse event is any problem that happens during the trial. Doctors keep track of all events that happen in trials, even if they do not think the events might be related to the study treatments."

Patients or their guardians can understand the trial purpose, voluntarily participate in and sign the informed consent form, and can accept follow-up visits.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Severe calcification in the target vessel, severe distortion of the target vessel or anatomical factors that make it hard for interventional devices to be in place;\n2. Ischemic symptoms are only associated with branch events;\n3. Severe stenosis or occlusion of tandem extracranial or intracranial vessels at the proximal or distal end of the target vessel;\n4. Angioplasty or stenting procedures is planned for extracranial vascular lesions with tandem intracranial vessels;\n5. History of endarterectomy in the extracranial segment of carotid artery and vertebral artery within 30 days;\n6.

                    "detailedDescription": "Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has profound detrimental effects on brain development and, as a result, has permanent consequences for cognition, learning, and behavior. Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) commonly have a range of neurocognitive impairments that directly lead to practical problems with learning, attention, working memory, task planning/execution, and decision making, among other areas of functioning. Despite the profound public health burden posed by FASD, there have been very few treatment studies in this population. This study will examine the effects of a cognitive remediation training augmented with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in children and adolescents with PAE. The study involves a baseline visit with cognitive testing, 5 sessions of tDCS (including the baseline visit) with active and sham arms, a 6th visit for cognitive testing."

                    "briefSummary": "Mental health problems are common in terms of lifetime prevalence and often occur in combination with chronic physical illnesses. It is therefore reasonable to assume that there is considerable mental health comorbidity among inpatients. A recent retrospective analysis of patient data from a tertiary care internal medicine clinic also showed that the length of stay in hospital was longer for patients with mental comorbidity. This effect was particularly pronounced in the case of severe physical multimorbidity.\n\nOur hypothesis is that the implementation of psychosocial risk screening as part of the inpatient admission process is suitable to identify the need for psychosomatic and social service counselling and treatment at an early stage and to address it appropriately from a medical, psychological and social service perspective in order to reduce the length of inhouse treatment.\n\nTwo consecutive studies are planned to test this hypothesis. The present study is a randomised feasibility study. Patients will be enrolled and assigned to the intervention or control group. Only the intervention group will receive screening. The psychosomatic and social screening will be differentiated according to previously defined risk categories. In some cases, established standardised questionnaires (PHQ-4, Audit-C, Clinical Frailty Scale, Six Item Screener) are used. In other cases, we have developed our own questions. Patients are screened by physicians or students in their practical year when they are admitted to our pilot ward. If the psychosomatic screening is positive and the patient agrees, they are referred to the psychosomatic consultation service. If the social service screening is positive, the patient will be seen by the social service.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to obtain informed consent from 30% of the eligible patients as a parameter for the feasibility and acceptance of such screening within an integrated psychosomatic and social service care concept. A study period of 3 months is planned for the feasibility study. The feasibility study will be analysed using descriptive statistics. The main study, which has not yet been applied for, is planned as a randomised intervention study. The main objective criterion will be to reduce the length of stay through screening and, if necessary, timely psychosomatic or social counselling.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Mental health problems are common in terms of lifetime prevalence and often occur in combination with chronic physical illnesses. Mental comorbidities in physically ill patients lead to higher morbidity and mortality, greater demands on the healthcare system and higher treatment costs.\n\nAmong medical inpatients it can therefore be assumed that there is considerable mental comorbidity. In a large retrospective analysis of around 28,500 patient data sets from the Department of Internal Medicine at Heidelberg University Hospital, we could show that the length of stay in hospital for patients with mental comorbidity was extended by a total of 2 days when compared with patients who had no documented mental comorbidity. This effect was particularly pronounced in the case of major physical multimorbidity. In addition to previously documented psychiatric and psychosomatic diseases, there is a tremendous lack of recognition and diagnosis of relevant mental comorbidities. It has also been shown that other non-acute medical factors, such as functional limitations, impairment of activities of daily living, frailty, cognitive limitations or the lack of a receiving care facility, prolong the length of stay.\n\nTo address these problems in health care, some guidelines recommend systematic screening for mental and functional risk-factors, but still this has not been implemented in routine inpatient medical wards. The implementation of psychosomatic risk screening as part of the inpatient admission process could be suitable for detecting the need for psychosomatic and social service at an early stage and addressing it accordingly with psychotherapy, psychopharmacy and qualified social support. It may also be possible to reduce the length of stay in hospital. In this pilot project, a psychosocial risk screening with subsequent psychosomatic assessment by a consultant and introduction to social services is to be evaluated with regard to the feasibility of integration into ward procedures and acceptance by patients. The study is designed as a randomized feasibility study. Patients are included in the study on admission to a medical ward and randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group. The intervention group receives the screening and if necessary subsequent further care, the control group does not receive screening.\n\nScreening focuses on previously defined psychosocial risk categories:\n\nAs part of the psychosomatic screening, the risk categories of sleep disorder and psychotropic drug use, depression, anxiety disorder, subjective disease burden, risky alcohol consumption, frailty and cognitive impairment are examined based on previous results.\n\nFor the social services screening, relevant consultation and intervention needs such as a general need for advice on social law issues, a lack of health insurance, a lack of financial security, the presence of a legal guardian, a need for care at home, an existing or possibly increased level of care and interest in follow-up treatment or rehabilitation measures are queried.\n\nIn the event of a conspicuous psychosomatic screening, a consecutive assessment is carried out by a psychosomatic consultant if consent is given. In the event of a conspicuous social services screening, a social worker is called. If the screening is negative, there will be no further assessment or consultation by the respective services at this time.\n\nThe current study serves to prepare a larger randomized trial to test the effect of a psychosocial risk screening together with a defined care path on the reduction of length of stay in patients with medical diseases."
