                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational study is to compare the effects of pirfenidone and nintedanib on lung function and radiologic findings in fibrotic lung diseases. The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n\u2022 Do these two drugs have equivalent effects on progression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis? If there is a comparison group: The investigators will compare patients with pulmonary fibrosis receiving pirfenidone with patients with pulmonary fibrosis receiving nintedanip.\n\nThe investigators will compare patients with pulmonary fibrosis receiving pirfenidone and patients with pulmonary fibrosis receiving nintedanip.\n\nPulmonary function test parameters at 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months and differences of 6 MWT parameters compared to baseline will be compared between the two groups.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The data of patients who were started Pirfenidone or Nintedanib treatment with the diagnosis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis or Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis according to An Official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Clinical Practice guideline and treated for at least one year in our department between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The included patients had not previously used steroids or similar drugs for lung disease. The study was initiated after approval of the local ethics committee.\n\nFile information, pulmonary function test parameters and radiologic data, gender, age and comorbidity information of all patients were obtained from the hospital database. Pulmonary function tests were performed using a COSMED Quark 2021 model device. Patients were divided into two groups as nintedanib and pirfenidone group and both groups were compared in terms of progression in pulmonary function tests and radiologic findings within 1 year of diagnosis. For this purpose, the difference of pulmonary function test parameters (FVC (mL-%), FEV1 (mL-%), FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75 (mL-%), and 6-minute walk test values at the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months of all patients from the baseline values at the time of diagnosis were analyzed and these differences were compared between the two groups.Thorax CT findings were also compared between the two groups for the presence of progression. Patients whose radiologic and PFT data at initial presentation were not available, patients whose treatment was discontinued before 1 year due to side effects or unresponsiveness or death, and patients who were switched between the two drugs before 1 year had elapsed were excluded from the study.\n\nStatistical analysis Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the normal distribution of the continuous variables. The data characterized by a normal distribution are expressed as mean\u00b1standard deviation. Student's t-tests was used for the comparison of the data which had a normal distribution. Mann-Whitney-U test was used for the comparison of the non-normally distributed data. The discrete variables were compared using Chi-squared test. P \\<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software (version 13.01, serial number 9069728, SPSS Inc., Chicago)."

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of an online intervention for people with troublesome asthma in primary care, involving a consultation with a primary care clinician to introduce and promote online peer support (i.e. support from other patients with asthma within an established and safe OHC). The main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the intervention feasible and acceptable to patients?\n* Can the research team recruit patients and collect health-related data to identify the impact of this intervention on patients and what are the challenges to pursue further research to evaluate this intervention in a trial?",
                    "detailedDescription": "This observational study will involve a non-randomised, mixed-methods, feasibility study, setting out to test and refine a digital social intervention for people with troublesome asthma in primary care. The feasibility study will consist of a number of steps, including a questionnaire survey to identify and recruit eligible patients, intervention delivery, collection of follow-up outcomes, and exit one-to-one interviews with a sample of patients and primary care clinicians. Provided the feasibility study is successful, there are plans to undertake a full randomised controlled trial.\n\nThe precise content of the survey is currently being co-developed with stakeholders. However, the research team envisages including questions about participants' demographic and socioeconomic data, asthma symptoms, control and self-management, quality of life, mental wellbeing, health literacy, and interest in digital social interventions. Completion of the survey should take around 15 minutes.\n\nEligible patients identified through the survey will be invited to receive the intervention (see 'Groups and Interventions' section below). The exact content of the intervention is still being co-developed with patients and clinicians. Clinicians delivering the intervention will be thoroughly trained (through an online workshop/session) on the practicalities of signing patients up to an OHC, including on seeking and recording consent and collecting baseline data. The precise content of training is still being developed in collaboration with various stakeholders.\n\nA number of outcomes, both self-reported and non-self-reported by patients, will be collected (see 'Outcome measures' section below). The self-reported outcome variables will be collected, via an online form designed on RedCap software, at baseline and at six months following the intervention. For the baseline collection, clinicians will add patients' responses to the online form at the time of delivering the intervention. For the follow-up collection, participants will receive a link to the online form, via a text message from the practice with which participants are registered, for self-submission (form completion should take 10-15 minutes).\n\nA sample of patients and clinicians will be invited to participate in a one-to-one, semi-structured interview. Clinicians will be interviewed shortly after delivering the intervention to all recruited patients, whereas patients will be interviewed at the end of the feasibility study (i.e. after the completion of the follow-up period). An interview topic guide composed of open-ended questions and prompts will be used to elicit experiences of delivering/receiving the intervention. Based on individual participants' preferences, interviews will take place either in person (within private meeting or consultation spaces in the general practices) or virtually (via Zoom platform). Interviews should last approximately 30-90 minutes, depending on how much each participant has to share, and will be audio recorded through digital recorders or by using the Cloud function in Zoom. Basic demographic data will be collected at the time of the interview."

The aim is for the intervention to involve a face-to-face, one-off consultation, lasting approximately 30 minutes, during which a primary care clinician will:\n\n* Signpost and sign patients up to the ALUK OHC, by thoroughly explaining terms of conditions of use and providing log in details.\n* Introduce norms and values for passive (just reading) and active (writing OHC posts) participation.\n* Encourage seeking and offering self-management information and support, by emphasising that the OHC could be used ad hoc (e.g. when feeling unwell, or when there are information or emotional needs).",

                    "detailedDescription": "Physical activity in childhood is an integral part of maintaining health and quality of life. Children who participate in routine physical activity are more likely to maintain a healthy body weight and are less likely to have heart disease, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure as adults. Children with chronic disease are often limited from full participation in exercise for various reasons -perceived physical limitations, either from the patient and family or from their medical provider, or because of symptoms which cause exercise to feel uncomfortable. As the number of children living and aging with chronic disease continues to grow, the researchers are hoping to expand the current exercise testing capabilities for both clinical care and research in order to (i) provide data to permit formulation of evidence-based guidelines for exercise in chronic childhood disease; (ii) improve understanding of limitations to exercise in this growing population; (iii) learn long-term implications of chronic childhood disease as these individuals enter adulthood."

                    "briefSummary": "The Post-traumatic Extension Contracture of the Knee (PECK) is a common complication following knee traumas. It is characterized by a restricted Range of Motion (ROM), pain, and discomfort in the affected knee.\n\nVarious factors can cause PECK, primarily inflammation and scar tissue formation. The underlying inflammatory state leads to the development of scar tissue, which - when combined with immobilization - results in the progressive stiffness of the knee. Additionally, prolonged immobilization leads to muscle atrophy and, consequently, reduced mobility and increased rigidity.\n\nAll these conditions contribute to a limited ROM, making it challenging to perform various daily activities.\n\nSometimes conservative treatments can be effective, but surgery is often necessary to restore joint functionality and alleviate pain.\n\nHistorically, various surgical approaches have been proposed to address post-traumatic knee stiffness.\n\nOpen surgery is typically reserved for cases where arthroscopic adhesion release and manipulation under anesthesia have not been successful. Over the last century, various open surgical techniques have been proposed.\n\nIn particular, arthromyolysis according to Judet was first described in the 1950s by the French orthopedic surgeon Jacques Judet. This technique involves a series of incisions and soft tissue releases, allowing the surgeon to resolve the stiffness of the quadriceps tendon caused by trauma or prolonged immobilization.\n\nAlthough effective in restoring knee joint functionality, arthromyolysis according to Judet is not without risks and potential complications. These include infection, massive bleeding, nerve and muscle-tendon injuries, and residual stiffness.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to analyze our case series related to arthromyolysis according to Judet for PECK. Clinical outcomes, complications, and patient satisfaction following this type of intervention will be evaluated."

                    "briefSummary": "Benralizumab is a humanised, afucosylated, monoclonal antibody against the interleukin (IL)-5 receptor (IL-5R) \u03b1 subunit that induces direct, rapid, and near-complete depletion of eosinophils in blood, airway tissue, and bone marrow through enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). This apoptotic process involves natural killer cells responsible for the controlled eosinophilic elimination. In the two pivotal phase III trials SIROCCO and CALIMA, benralizumab was well tolerated, significantly reduced asthma exacerbations by up to 51%, and improved lung function as well as disease control in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and blood eosinophil count of \u2265 300 cells/\u03bcL blood, receiving both ICS and LABA.\n\nAccording to the summary of product's characteristics (SmPC) of benralizumab in Russia, it can be used for an add-on maintenance treatment for adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. All patients enrolled in the BEST study will comply with the SmPC approved by the Russian Ministry of Health.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is a multicentre, single arm, non-interventional observational, prospective study that will include patients older than 18 years, who qualify for the treatment with benralizumab according to the SmPC in participating research centres (study cites) focusing on severe eosinophilic asthma in Russia. The decision by the physician to start benralizumab is made independently from study inclusion and patient informed consent. Patients who meet the study criteria will be enrolled and, as outlined in the current label of benralizumab approved by Russian Ministry of Health, are planned to receive 3 subcutaneously (s.c.) applied doses of 30 mg benralizumab, from weeks 0 (baseline) every 4 weeks and then every 8 week. A follow-up visit to assess the sustainability of achieved changes will be done after 56 weeks. No study drug will be provided, all patients will be on commercially available drug. Additional two study visits at week 1 and 2 can also be done remotely via phone calls to obtain the paper-based SGRQ, ACQ-5, PGI-C and PGI-S questionnaires."

                    "briefSummary": "The purpose is to evaluate the biomarker effect, safety, and tolerability of investigational study drugs in participants who are known to have an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-causing mutation. Stage 1 will determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or slows the rate of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) pathological disease accumulation demonstrated by A\u03b2 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Stage 2 will evaluate the effect of early A\u03b2 plaque reduction/prevention on disease progression by assessing downstream non-A\u03b2 biomarkers of AD (e.g., CSF total tau, p-tau, NfL) compared to an external control group from the DIAN-OBS natural history study and the DIAN-TU-001 placebo-treated participants.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This study will recruit participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network observational study (DIAN-OBS), a multicenter international study supported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number U01-AG032438; RJ Bateman), Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) sites, DIAN-TU partner sites, DIAN Expanded Registry (DIAN-EXR), and families identified by the sites. As part of the DIAN-TU-002 protocol, participants undergo longitudinal assessments that include clinical assessment, cognitive testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid imaging, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\nParticipants in DIAN are recruited from families that have at least one member who has been identified as having a mutation linked to dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). The mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes that are associated with DIAD have very high penetrance (near 100%). This study will enroll individuals who are either known to have a known disease-causing mutation, or who are at risk for such a mutation (the child or sibling of a proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status. Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family and for each mutation, an age at onset is determined for each affected parent or mutation as part of the DIAN-OBS study protocol. This study will enroll participants who are asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age at onset for their family and/or mutation.\n\nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world. These constraints necessitate a specialized study design. Participants in this study will not yet have developed any symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause DIAD and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Further, most mutation carriers will have levels of AD-associated amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and non-A\u03b2 biomarkers that are the same as non-carriers. Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. However, the goal of this study is to address whether decreasing plaque prone A\u03b2 peptides in the absence of measurable or mild elevations of A\u03b2 plaques in participants with minimal to no amyloid plaque at baseline can lead to the subsequent prevention of non-A\u03b2 biomarkers of disease progression. Additionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to know whether they have the disease-associated mutation, some of the at-risk individuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease-causing mutations; they will be \"mutation-negative.\" It is important to enroll these participants to avoid coercion (e.g., potential participants may feel pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status to be eligible for the trial). These mutation-negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group and data will be used to determine normal ranges of outcome. Participants and site study staff will remain blinded as to these individuals' active or placebo group assignment and mutation status. Thus, the study will be blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation carriers who are aware of their genetic status. There may be exceptional circumstances as required by local regulation or health authorities where enrollment may be restricted to mutation carriers only, but such mandates will be thoroughly documented and agreed upon by the governing regulatory agency and the study sponsor.\n\nThis study is an adaptive-platform-based study. Several different therapies (each referred to as a study drug arm) may be tested in order to increase the likelihood that an effective treatment will be discovered. The compounds are selected for this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile. In the case of multiple study arms, the study design includes a pooled placebo group (referred to as the mutation positive placebos) shared by all study drug arms. Mutation carriers will be assigned to a study drug arm and subsequently randomized within that arm in an overall 1:1 ratio to active drug: placebo. Mutation-negative participants will all receive placebo treatment. Participants and study staff will not be blinded as to which study drug arm each participant has been assigned; they will be blinded to whether participants have been randomized to receive active drug or placebo.\n\nThe study has 2 treatment periods: Stage 1 is a blinded placebo-controlled period that will continue until the last randomized participant completes 4 years of treatment (i.e., a common close design), and Stage 2 is an open-label period of 4 years (with a planned 2-year interim efficacy analysis) in which all mutation carriers will receive active drug. At the start of Stage 2, participants who were randomized to placebo in Stage 1 will follow the same dose titration schedule and MRI safety schedule used in Stage 1. Participants who were randomized to active drug in Stage 1 will follow a mock dose titration and will have the same MRI safety schedule used during the initial drug titration as Stage 1 but will remain on the dose that they were on at the end of Stage 1. This will protect the blind to the original treatment assignment from Stage 1. Participants, investigators, and the sponsor's clinical team will remain blinded throughout the study to the Stage 1 treatment assignment.\n\nStage 1 of the study is designed to test whether the study drug can slow, prevent, or reverse progression of A\u03b2 pathology associated with AD and Stage 2 is designed to assess the study drug's effect on non-amyloid biomarkers of AD that may lead to future slowing or prevention of clinical symptoms of dementia.\n\nBiomarker, cognitive, and/or clinical endpoints will be specified for each study drug arm. Biomarker data will be analyzed for pre-specified endpoints consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and other AD biomarker outcomes. The clinical and cognitive assessments are designed to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of dementia as well as cognitive and clinical decline in symptomatic groups.\n\nRoche announced a decision to discontinue most of the company's global trials of gantenerumab. The DIAN-TU has paused the DIAN-TU-002 Primary Prevention Trial related to gantenerumab while considering other potential options for this platform trial.\n\nThe DIAN-TU plans to re-launch the DIAN-TU-002 Primary Prevention Trial with remternetug in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company as part of this Master Protocol. The remternetug arm is posted under NCT06647498."

Participant is at least 18 years old.\n3. People of childbearing potential\n\n   1. Must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (V1)\n   2. Must agree not to try to become pregnant during the study until 5 half-lives after the last dose of any study drug.\n   3. Must agree not to breastfeed from the time of signed ICF until 5 half-lives after the last dose of any study drug.\n   4. If partner is not sterilized, must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measuresfrom screening (V1) until 5 half lives after last dose of any study drug\n4. Participants must fulfill mutation status and EYO criteria:\n\n   1. Participant is a carrier of a mutation in an APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 gene that is associated with DIAD or does not know their mutation status and there is a mutation in their family pedigree that puts them at a direct risk of inheriting the known mutation;\n   2. Participant is -25 to -11 EYO based on their mutation type or family pedigree Note: If the at-risk parent is deemed a non-carrier through confirmed genetic testing at any time during the study, the participant will be withdrawn.\n5. Cognitive status of participant is normal (CDR-SB 0).\n6. Fluency in DIAN-TU trial approved language and evidence of adequate premorbid intellectual functioning. Participants must be fluent in languages for which cognitive and clinical measures have been translated and validated for use in the DIAN-TU. Fluency is generally defined as daily or frequent functional use of a language generally from birth or a young age. In cultures where multiple languages are spoken or for participants who are multilingual, determination as to whether a participant's level of fluency in languages for which clinical and cognitive measures are available meets qualification for the study should be made by the site PI.\n7. Participant has adequate visual and auditory abilities to perform all aspects of the cognitive and clinical assessments.\n8. Participant is receiving stable doses of medication(s) for the treatment of non-excluded medical condition(s) for at least 30 days prior to baseline visit (V2) except for medications taken for episodic conditions (e.g., migraine abortive therapy, antibiotics, and other medications for upper respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments).\n9. The participant has a study partner who in the PI's judgment can provide accurate information as to the participant's cognitive and functional abilities, who agrees to provide information at the study visits that require study partner input for scale completion, and who signs the necessary ICF, if applicable.\n10. The participant agrees not to donate blood or blood products for transfusion from the time of Screening (V1) for a study drug arm, for the duration of the study, and for 5 half lives after the final dose of study drug.\n11. In the opinion of the PI, the participant will be compliant and have a high probability of completing the study.\n12. The participant is able and willing to complete all study-related testing, evaluations, and procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Significant neurologic disease (other than AD) or psychiatric disease that may currently or during the study affect cognition or the participant's ability to complete the study. This would include disorders such as: recent or severe head trauma causing cognitive change, seizure disorder, neurodegenerative disease other than DIAD, hydrocephalus, cerebral/spinal hematoma, inflammatory disease, CNS infection (e.g., encephalitis or meningitis), neoplasm, toxic exposure, metabolic disorder (including hypoxic or hypoglycemic episodes) or endocrine disorder; psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depression, or any other psychiatric condition/disorder which could significantly interfere with the participant's cooperative participation (e.g., prominent anxiety, agitation or behavioral problems). Disorders that are controlled medically or remote history of these disorders (e.g., history of febrile seizures in childhood) that are not likely to interfere with cognitive function and compliance with study procedures are not exclusionary.\n2. At high risk for suicide, e.g., significant suicidal ideation or attempt within last 12 months, current major depression (as defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition \\[DSM-V\\]), or increased suicide risk based on screening Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Current stable mild depression or current use of antidepressant medications is not exclusionary.\n3. History of clinically evident stroke or history of clinically important carotid or vertebrobasilar stenosis, plaque, or other prominent risk factor for stroke or cerebral hemorrhage (including atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation, documented transient ischemic attack \\[TIA\\] in the last 12 months). Low dose aspirin (\u2264 325 mg daily) is not exclusionary.\n4. Alcohol or substance use sufficient to meet DSM-V criteria currently or within the past year.\n5. History of or Baseline visit brain MRI scan indicative of any other significant abnormality, definite microhemorrhages, evidence of a cerebral contusion, encephalomalacia, or aneurysms. Minor or clinically insignificant imaging findings are not exclusionary.\n6. Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, or foreign metal objects in the eyes, skin, or body which would preclude MRI scan.\n7. Cardiovascular complications such as uncontrolled hypertension, history of myocardial infarcts, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, long QT interval on ECG likely to interfere with participation in or analysis of the trial in the opinion of the investigator\n8. Hepatic or renal abnormalities that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with participation in or analysis of the trial.\n9. History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, history of Hepatitis B infection within the past year, history of Hepatitis C infection which has not been adequately treated or history of spirochete infection of the CNS, (e.g., syphilis, Lyme or borreliosis) or history of other infection with high risk for interfering with participation or interpretation of the study in the opinion of the investigator.\n10. History of clinically significant multiple or severe drug allergies, significant atopy, or severe post-treatment hypersensitivity reactions (including but not limited to erythema multiforme major, linear IgA dermatosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and/or exfoliative dermatitis) or sensitivity to study-drug specific PET imaging agents with a high risk for interfering with participation or interpretation of the study in the opinion of the investigator.\n11. Treatment with immunosuppressive medications (e.g., systemic corticosteroids) within 90 days prior to Baseline (V2) visit (topical and nasal corticosteroids and inhaled corticosteroids for asthma are permitted) or chemotherapeutic agents for malignancy within the last 3 years.\n12. Current clinically significant abnormalities of thyroid function, or clinically significant deficiency in vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 less than the lower limits of normal with normal methylmalonic acid (MMA)/homocysteine is not deemed clinically significant, therefore not exclusionary.\n13. Unstable or poorly controlled diabetes which the investigator believes may interfere with participation in or analysis of the study protocol. Participants may be rescreened after 3 months to allow optimization of diabetic control\n14. Morbid obesity with significant comorbidities or that would preclude MRI imaging.\n15. Current use of anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban). Daily use of low dose (\\< 325 mg) aspirin is not exclusionary.\n16. Have been exposed to a monoclonal antibody targeting A\u03b2 peptide within the past 6 months or 5 half-lives from screening, whichever is longer.\n17. Received any other investigational pharmacological treatment within 3 months of Screening or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.\n\n    Note: Use of approved treatments for AD and other medications may be permitted in this study in accordance with the guidelines in the Concomitant Medications, Section 5.1 of this protocol.\n18. Lack of sufficient venous access.\n19. Clinically relevant abnormalities in hematology, coagulation, or clinical chemistry.\n20. History of cancer that the investigator believes has high risk of recurrence and impacting study participation or analysis.\n21. Any other medical condition that could be expected to progress, recur, or change to such an extent that it could bias the assessment of the clinical or mental status of the participant to a significant degree or put the participant at special risk.\n22. Currently, or within the last month prior to screening, participated in a clinical study, including a nonpharmacological study, without prior approval.\n23. Participants with the \"Dutch\" APP E693Q mutation.\n24. Unable to fully complete baseline visit (V2) procedures with appropriate cognitive and clinical scores for eligibility.",

                    "briefSummary": "Estimated costs, from thirty days prior to lung transplant up through six months post surgery, exceed 1 million dollars per patient and routine medical costs average approximately fifty thousand dollars per year thereafter. Prior to transplant, lung transplant recipients self restrict activity due to severe respiratory limitations, resulting in reduced muscle mass and qualitative changes in large skeletal muscles. After transplant, despite improved lung function, studies consistently report that lung recipients fail to reach predicted physical function and physical activity. Nearly seventy percent are at risk of developing hypertension within the first five years due to side effects of immunosuppression and an inactive lifestyle worsens this risk. Consequently, full benefits of transplant may not be achieved. Few studies have tested ways to engage lung recipients in self management of exercise and adopt an active lifestyle. Lung Transplant Go LTGO is a behavioral exercise intervention that provides individualized exercise training integrated with behavioral coaching delivered in the recipient's home. Exercise training will focus on assisting lung recipients to learn and practice exercises to reverse muscle conditioning. Behavioral coaching will assist them to develop the skills to self manage physical activity in daily life and maintain this as a sustained habit using strategies that include incremental goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback and problem solving.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is a two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing LTGO to enhanced usual care (EUC). Based on estimations using a published RCT, effect sizes measured by Cohen's d ranged from 0.64 to 1.45 across outcome variables (i.e., 0.64 for physical function; 0.73-0.99 for physical activity; and 1.19 and1.45 for systolic and diastolic BP with 80% power, \u03b1=0.05). With a final sample of 80 subjects (40 per group) we will have 80% power to detect an effect size as small as 0.64 (\u03b1=0.05, two-tailed) from independent sample t-test for measures of physical function, physical activity and hypertension onset/control. Recruiting and randomizing 112 individuals (56 in LTGO \\& 56 in EUC) will allow for up to 30% attrition. Participants will be randomized to LTGO or EUC (1:1). The biostatistician will randomize participants using a blocked randomization scheme, stratified by sex (male vs. female) and length of hospital stay (\u22642 wks vs.\\>2 wks). The block size (2 or 4) will be randomly selected to prevent prediction of group assignment. An \"intention-to-treat\" (ITT) approach will be used. All subjects will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of adherence to the protocol, treatment received, and/or withdrawal from the protocol. Endorsed by international regulatory guidelines, the ITT approach is widely used in RCT because it minimizes the potential for the introduction of biases into data analysis and maintains prognostic balance generated from original random treatment allocation. Although the ITT approach is recommended for efficacy analysis in RCTs, the sensitivity of the results assumes that ITT will be explored using information collected regarding fidelity and dosage (e.g., number of sessions completed)."

Results are not required prior to initiating treatment on protocol, unless patients do not have other test results by IHC or FISH confirming HER2 overexpression.\n* Patients must have recurrent or persistent HER2 overexpressing endometrial cancer or endometrial carcinosarcoma. HER2 overexpression is defined as 3+ by IHC or 2+ with gene amplification by FISH (HER2/CEP17 ratio \u2265 2) or HER2 amplified (fold change \u2265 2) on MSK IMPACT.\n* Histologic documentation of diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma or carcinosarcoma is required.\n* Age \u2265 18 years\n* Patients must have had at least one but no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for management of endometrial carcinoma (including neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy). Initial treatment may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and/or consolidation/maintenance therapy. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer WILL be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen. Prior hormonal therapy will not count as a prior regimen. Prior treatment with trastuzumab is allowed.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* LVEF \u2265 50% on baseline screening ECHO.\n* Resolution of adverse effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy to Grade \u2264 1 prior to first study treatment (with the exception of alopecia or clinically insignificant laboratory values).\n* Patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by RECIST (version 1.1). Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each non-nodal lesion must be 10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be \u2265 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI.\n* No active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection).\n* All patients must consent to mandatory pre-treatment and post-treatment core needle biopsies.\n* Patients must have adequate hematological, liver, cardiac and kidney function within 14 days prior to first treatment:\n\n  1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 10\\^9/L (\\> 1500 per mm\\^3)\n  2. Platelet \u2265 100 X 109/L (\\>100,000 per mm\\^3)\n  3. Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL\n  4. Serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). (Unless Gilbert's Syndrome, for which Bilirubin \u2264 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), without concurrent clinically significant liver disease) AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) \u2264 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be \u2264 5x ULN.\n  5. Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).\n* For patients of childbearing potential, agreement to use two effective forms of contraception (e.g., surgical sterilization, a reliable barrier method, birth control pills, or contraceptive hormone implants) and to continue its use for the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after the last ZW25 dose.\n* Agree to practice total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.\n\n  1. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless 1 of the following applies: She is considered to be permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal ligation, and bilateral oophorectomy.\n  2. She is postmenopausal, defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level consistently in the postmenopausal range (30 mIU/mL or higher) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to confirm a postmenopausal state.\n  3. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result less than 3 day prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment.\n\nPatients or their legally authorized representative (LAR) must be willing and able to sign the informed consent form, and to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women who are pregnant or lactating or women of childbearing potential (WCBP) not protected by highly-effective contraceptive methods.\n* \\> Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy.\n* History of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke within the prior six months.\n* History of NYHA Class II-IV heart failure, no serious arrhythmia.\n* History of MI or unstable angina within 6 months of study initiation.\n* Patients with a lifetime cumulative dose of anthracycline \\>300 mg/m2 or who have received anthracycline treatment within 90 days of the expected first dose of ZW25 are not eligible for treatment.\n* Prior hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibodies.\n* Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. Patients with previously resolved hepatitis B infection are eligible. Presence of positive test results for hepatitis B infection who have resolved the infection (defined by positive for HB surface antibody (anti-HBs) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is negative for HBV DNA are eligible. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if testing for HCV RNA is negative.\n* Known HIV infection.\n* Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease).\n* Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment.\n* Known untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or corticosteroids for symptomatic control) leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\n\nPatients with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided that they meet all of the following criteria:\n\n1. Presence of measurable disease outside the CNS\n2. No radiographic evidence of worsening upon the completion of CNSdirected therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening radiographic study\n3. No history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage\n4. No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone as therapy for CNS disease (anticonvulsants at a stable dose are allowed)\n5. Absence of leptomeningeal disease\n\n   * Inability to comply with study and follow-up procedures.\n   * Known allergy or hypersensitivity to the components of ZW25 formulation.\n   * Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications.\n   * Active or history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\n   * Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug treatment, including but not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia.\n   * Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., for prevention of urinary tract infection or to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) are eligible for the study. Patients receiving antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection are also eligible.\n   * Administration of a live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment or anticipated need for such a vaccine during study. Patients must agree not to receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., Flumist\u00ae) within 4 weeks prior to treatment.)\n   * Participation in another clinical study with receipt of an investigational product during the last 4 weeks.\n   * History of another primary malignancy except for:\n\na. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease \u2265 2 years before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for recurrence. b. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease. c. Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease (e.g., cervical cancer in situ). d. Adequately treated stage 1 breast cancer.\n\n* Receipt of the last dose of anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies) \\< 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Receipt of the last dose of hormonal therapy within \\< 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Any prior radiation therapy must be discontinued at least four weeks prior to registration.\n* QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) \u2265 470 ms on screening electrocardiograms (ECG) using QTC Federica.\n* History of small or large bowel obstruction within 3 months of registration, including subjects with palliative gastric drainage catheters. Subjects with palliative diverting ileostomy or colostomy are allowed if they have been symptom free for more than 3 months.\n* Subjects with refractory ascites, defined as ascites needing drainage catheter or therapeutic paracentesis more often than every 4 weeks.\n* Ongoing bowel perforation or presence of bowel fistula or abscess within 3 months of registration.",
