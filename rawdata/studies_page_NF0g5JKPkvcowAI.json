The outcomes for the groups receiving CMV vaccine will be compared to the outcomes for the group that received the placebo vaccine to see if there is a clinical benefit. For this trial, donors and recipients must have matched HLA genotype (matched at 5/6 or 6/6 HLA loci).",

Qualified donors and/or CMV-seropositive recipients (donor/recipient pairs or recipient-only subjects) will be assigned randomly to receive either a CMV vaccine or a placebo vaccine. Donors will receive 3 vaccines prior to donation and recipients will receive 1 vaccine pretransplant and up to three vaccines posttransplant. Recipients will be followed for up to 1 year after transplant to evaluate the safety of the vaccine and to see if there is a clinical benefit in the group that received the CMV vaccine. The incidence rates of CMV infection, disease, and other complications from immunosuppression and/or transplantation will be studied."

When CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are performed, this must be with contras per pancreas protocol. Imagining with a PET/MRI alone is acceptable on study. If a PET/CT is performed, a separate pancreas protocol CT is required for inclusion.\n* Must have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the discretion of medical oncology\n* Medical oncology consultation to confirm that patient is an appropriate candidate for concurrent chemotherapy and surgical oncology consultation for confirmation of resection status.\n\nNote: Patients who have received previous chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer are allowed to participate in this study, unless they experienced a previous allergic reaction to the drugs used in this study.\n\n* Planned to receive CRT, consisting of PBT or IMRT (45 Gy/15 fractions) with concurrent chemotherapy with 5FU or Capecitabine.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1 or Karnofsky Performance Status 70-100 (Appendix III).\n* Willing to sign consent onto the Mayo Clinic Radiotherapy Patient Outcomes Registry and Biobanking study, IRB 15-000136\n* Patients do not need to agree to Biobank blood draw.\n* Patients at Mayo Clinic Arizona are not required to consent to the Registry.\n* Willing to sign consent for blood collection onto the Pancreas SPORE, IRB 354-06.\n* Able to complete standard of care clinical questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presence of non-regional nodal involvement or distant metastatic disease (M1)\n* Prior RT to the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis\n* History of prior malignancy \\< 2 years of enrollment, except non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix\n* Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be HIV positive and not currently receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\nNote: Patients known to be HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are eligible for this trial.\n\n* Receiving any investigational agent concurrent with CRT which would be considered as a treatment for the primary neoplasm.\n* Any of the following because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n* Co-morbid systemic or psychiatric illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.",

                    "detailedDescription": "Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world with approximately 300,000 births per year of children with sickle cell disease. It is linked to the presence of a mutation on the beta globin chain (beta S mutation), responsible for the expression of the S variant of hemoglobin (HbS). Inherited autosomal recessively, is characterized, among other things, by intense painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) of bone triggered by cold, dehydration, stress or fatigue, but also sometimes without an identified triggering factor. The management of VOC requires, among other things, the rapid administration of analgesics. Level 1 seems ineffective and patients most often resort to level 2 from the start of symptoms, then level 3 in a hospital setting if the latter are ineffective. Sickle cell patients also frequently present with chronic pain, sometimes linked to complications of the disease (chronic leg ulcers, osteonecrosis in particular) but also without an identified cause.\n\nThe prescription of level 2 is therefore quite widely used in these patients for both the management of acute and chronic pain. In addition, self-management of pain has been encouraged for several years by caregivers, with the risk of more or less controlled self-medication, but little data is available in the literature.\n\nConsequently, repeated exposure to opioids, as well as the painful context, constitute risk factors for the development of an opioid use disorder (OUD).\n\nTo date, there is no comprehensive data among adults with sickle cell disease concerning the prevalence of consumption of level 2 and 3 analgesics at home and the use of cannabis or CBD for analgesic use. Preliminary data shows a very high prevalence of OUD in these patients, above 50%, but more precise additional studies are necessary to objectify these results and implement appropriate multidisciplinary care.\n\nThe general objective of this project is to establish an exhaustive collection on the addiction of sickle cell patients followed in a sickle cell reference center (h\u00f4pital Henri Mondor, h\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades and h\u00f4pital europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris).

Participants recorded a sleep interference score in the patient diary once daily from the day after the screening visit (Visit 1) through the end-of-treatment (Visit 7)/early termination visit. Every morning upon awakening, prior to taking the study drug, each participant selected the number that best described his/her sleep interference experience during the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 = pain did not interfere with sleep to 10 = pain completely interfered with sleep. Negative values indicate an improvement in sleep interference. The weekly average daily sleep interference score (ADSIS) was based on the sleep interference scores from the patient diaries.",

Based on the 12 questions, the following scales were calculated: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakening due to shortness of breath or headache, sleep adequacy, sleep somnolence, 9-item sleep item index, sleep quantity, and optimal sleep (not reported since it is a yes/no response). Each scale was given a score ranging from 1 (all the time) to 5 (none of the time), except for the 9-item sleep item index. Individual item scores of the 9-item sleep index were averaged and the total score ranged from 1 to 5. For all items reported, higher scores indicate an improvement in sleep disturbance.",

These profiles were combined into an overall health utilities index, and a visual analog scale (VAS) that measured the participants' perceptions of overall health. EQ-5D-5L index scores range from -0.59 (worst health state) to 1 (best possible health state). EQ VAS scores range from 0 (worse imaginable health or worst outcome) to 100 (best imaginable health or best outcome). Higher scores for index value and VAS indicate better outcome.",
