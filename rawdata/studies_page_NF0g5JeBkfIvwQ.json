                    "briefSummary": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in older Americans. COPD increases in frequency with age, and older adults with COPD often have significant unmet geriatrics-palliative care needs that results in reduced quality of life, high healthcare utilization, and care at the end of life that does not align with the values and wishes of patients and their care partners. Older adults with COPD could benefit from proactive geriatrics-palliative care before the end of life. However, no geriatrics-palliative care interventions have been systematically developed and tested in community-dwelling older adults with COPD and their care partners. As the number of older adults with COPD increases to levels unmatched by current palliative care workforce trends, innovative strategies are desperately needed to improve the delivery of geriatrics-palliative care in COPD before the end of life.\n\nProject EPIC (Empowering People to Independence in COPD) is a multiphase study to refine and pilot test the EPIC telephonic nurse coaching intervention in older adults with COPD and their care partners. EPIC is informed by the ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise Before Life Ends) early palliative care intervention that improved quality of life and mood for patients with advanced cancer and has been iteratively refined over decades and rigorous randomized controlled trial testing. In the intervention, palliative care-trained nurse coaches deliver the Charting Your Course Curriculum over the phone to patients (six sessions) and their care partners (four sessions), with activities and monthly telephone follow-up following a manualized curriculum. We conducted a formative evaluation in a diverse and multidisciplinary group of stakeholders to refine ENABLE for patients with COPD and pilot tested the potential feasibility of the refined intervention, EPIC, in patients and their care partners.\n\nThe current study summatively evaluates EPIC through a hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot randomized controlled trial in dyads of community-dwelling older adults with moderate to very severe COPD and their care partners randomized to usual COPD care (control) versus usual COPD care + EPIC (intervention). The primary outcomes are trial and intervention feasibility and acceptability. Secondary geriatrics-palliative care outcomes include Life-Space mobility, quality of life, cognitive impairment, functional status, healthcare utilization, palliative care uptake, and care partner burden."

The main question it aims to answer are : knowledge of own vaccination status is less than 50% among healthcare workers working at Groupe Hospitalier Sud Ile de France and the assessment of the relationship between healthcare workers of Groupe Hospitalier Sud Ile de France and vaccination in general.",

Even healthcare professionals are reluctant to be vaccinated , particularly in view of annual vaccination rates against seasonal influenza: 22% were vaccinated against seasonal influenza in 2022, and 25.9% knew their general vaccination status.\n\nAs part of the national \"European Vaccination Week\" event organized by the French Ministry of Health and Prevention, we propose a questionnaire designed for hospital healthcare workers to assess their knowledge of their own vaccination status, and evaluate their attitude with vaccination.\n\nThe link to the questionnaire will be forwarded to staff e-mail addresses, and it will be administered on a one-off basis. At least 100 professionals will be surveyed. Each participant is expected to complete the questionnaire in 10 minutes, and the total duration of the research is one week."

                    "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat men who have metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\n\nmCRPC is a cancer of the prostate (male reproductive gland found below the bladder) that has spread to other parts of the body. This type of prostate cancer does not respond to hormone treatment used to lower the level of testosterone, a male sex hormone, to prevent cancer from growing.\n\nThe study treatment 225Ac-PSMA-Trillium, also called BAY3563254, is under development to treat advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It works by binding to PSMA and giving off radiation that can damage cancer cells and stop them from growing.\n\nThe main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn:\n\n* How safe is BAY3563254 in participants.\n* What is the recommended dose of BAY3563254 that is safe and works well that will be further tested in Part 2 of the study.\n* How well does BAY3563254 work in participants.\n\nTo answer this, the researchers will look at:\n\n* The number and severity of medical problems including serious medical problems that participants experience after taking BAY3563254\n* The number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at each dose level. A DLT is a medical problem caused by a drug that is too severe to continue the use of that specific dose.\n* The number of participants whose cancer completely disappears (complete response) or reduces by at least 30% (partial response) after taking the treatment (also known as objective response rate (ORR))\n* The number of participants who have a decrease in the levels of PSA\\* by at least 50% in their blood (also known as PSA50). PSA is a protein made by the prostate gland. High levels of PSA may indicate the presence of prostate cancer.\n* Participants' best response to treatment based on their PSA levels (also known as the best overall PSA response).\n\nThe study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the most appropriate dose of BAY3563254 for use in the second part of the study. For this, each participant will receive one of different increasing amounts of BAY3563254. They will take BAY3563254 as an injection into a vein. All participants in the second part of the study, called dose expansion, will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY3563254 that was identified from the first part of the study.\n\nParticipants in this study will take the study treatment once every 6 weeks, which is known as a treatment cycle. Each participant will have up to 4 of these treatment cycles, if the participant benefits from the treatment. Each participant will be in the study for approximately 6 years, including a screening phase of up to 30 days, 6 months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow up phase of 60 months after the end of treatment.\n\nIn addition, substudies performed during both dose escalation and dose expansion parts of the study will evaluate:\n\n* the clearance of radioactivity from the body over time\n* the doses of radiation that are delivered to normal organs and tumors\n* the ability of an experimental agent (Tris-POC) to decrease the amount of radiation absorbed by normal organs.\n\nDuring the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* take blood and urine samples\n* check vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature\n* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* take tumor samples if required\n* check if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and bone scan\n* check the tumor status using PET (positron emission tomography)\n* check the amount of radiation absorbed by tumors and normal organs using SPECT/CT (single-photon emission tomography and computed tomography scan)\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.\n\nThe treatment period ends with a visit in 6-12 weeks after the last BAY3563254 dose. About 6-12 weeks after the last dose and every 6 weeks thereafter, the study doctors and their team will check the participants' health and any changes in their cancer. This active follow-up period ends after 18 months. The long-term follow-up period will start after the end of the active follow-up visit and will continue for up to 60 months after the the last BAY3563254 dose. Participants will be contacted, typically by phone call or clinic visit, approximately every 12 weeks after the end of active follow-up."

                    "briefSummary": "This phase III trial studies how well blinatumomab works in combination with chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed, standard risk B-lymphoblastic leukemia or B-lymphoblastic lymphoma with or without Down syndrome. Monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as vincristine, dexamethasone, prednisone, prednisolone, pegaspargase, methotrexate, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and thioguanine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Leucovorin decreases the toxic effects of methotrexate. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. Giving blinatumomab and combination chemotherapy may work better than combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with B-ALL. This trial also assigns patients into different chemotherapy treatment regimens based on risk (the chance of cancer returning after treatment). Treating patients with chemotherapy based on risk may help doctors decide which patients can best benefit from which chemotherapy treatment regimens.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine in a randomized manner if the addition of 2 cycles of blinatumomab to standard therapy improves disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with standard risk (SR) B-ALL and higher risk features (SR-High), and patients with standard-risk average (SR-Avg) B-ALL who are negative for minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry but have detectable or indeterminate MRD as measured by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) at end of induction (EOI).\n\nII. To confirm that boys in the standard-risk favorable (SR-Fav) subset of B-ALL, with or without Down syndrome (DS), will maintain a 5-year DFS of greater than 93% when treated with a standard chemotherapy regimen with a treatment duration of 2 years from the start of interim maintenance I (IM1).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

Two escalating dose (low dose and medium dose) cohorts are planned, as well as one bridging cohort which will allocate patients to receive either low or medium dose. The duration of the study is 5 years. During the first year, patients will be evaluated for the effect of LY3884963 on safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and efficacy. Patients will follow up for an additional 4 years to monitor safety and changes on selected biomarkers and clinical outcomes."

NOTE: Pneumococcal vaccine and/or shingles vaccine administration is allowed at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of immunosuppressant regimen.\n* Use of blood thinners in the 2 weeks prior to screening, or anticipated use of blood thinners during the study. Antiplatelet therapies are acceptable if the patient is medically able to temporarily stop 48 hours to 7 days (depending on the antiplatelet medication used) prior to and at least 48 hours after ICM injection and LP. Note: the use of blood thinners as part of prophylaxis or treatment of an emergent VTE or another AE during the study does not exclude the patient, unless there is a baseline high risk of thromboembolic events, and use of blood thinners is highly anticipated in the opinion of the Investigator.\n* Contraindications or intolerance to imaging methods (MRA, MRI, and/or computed tomography \\[CT\\]), including claustrophobia and intolerance to contrast agents used for MRI, MRA, or CT (including, but not limited to, gadolinium contrast agents and iohexol).\n* Contraindications to general anesthesia or deep sedation.\n* Positive urine test for drugs of abuse (including opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, barbiturates, and phencyclidine) without prescription at Screening and on Day 1.\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply",

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this project is to observe the benefits induced by physical activity during a supervised adapted physical activity program at SPORMED.\n\nMethodology: By agreeing to participate in this study, participation in a supervised adapted physical activity (APA) program at SPORMED and undergoing a series of evaluations will be required.\n\nAt the start of the adapted physical activity program (T0), two APA sessions per week will be carried out for eight weeks. These group sessions, involving four participants, last 1 hour and are divided into 30 minutes of aerobic work on an ergometer followed by 30 minutes of muscle strengthening of the four limbs and core exercises, with or without small equipment. There is also the option to add a 45-minute balneotherapy session once a week, if desired and no contraindications are present. At the end of the eight weeks (T1), a follow-up phase begins, consisting of one APA session per week for another eight weeks. The session will be identical to the previously described sessions and can also be complemented by a balneotherapy session. The APA program will conclude after these 12 weeks (T2). A total of 24 indoor sessions will be offered, which can be supplemented by 12 balneotherapy sessions. Attendance at the sessions will be recorded.\n\nAdditionally, a series of evaluations will take place at T0, T1, and T2. These include physical and anthropometric assessments at SPORMED lasting approximately 30 minutes. They involve weight and body composition evaluation (2 minutes), height measurement (1 minute), waist and hip circumference measurements using a tape measure (2 minutes). Next, an upper limb strength test will be conducted, involving three maximal contractions during a handgrip test with 30-second rest intervals (2 minutes), followed by a lower limb strength test, which involves performing as many sit-to-stand repetitions from a chair with a backrest and without armrests as possible in 30 seconds (30 seconds). Then, a balance test, including bipodal and unipodal stance (30 seconds on both feet, followed by each foot individually), will be performed, and finally, a 6-minute walking test, during which the longest possible distance must be covered (without running) in 6 minutes (6 minutes, with the option to stop if necessary).\n\nAdditionally, four self-assessment questionnaires on quality of life, fatigue, physical activity level, and food consumption must be completed at home (about 20 to 30 minutes).",
                    "detailedDescription": "Patient volunteers were referred to Spormed sports medicine center by an oncologist and/or general practitioner. To be eligible for the study, participants had to be over 18 years old and have a diagnosis of cachexia-inducing cancer. Metastasis could be present or not. Participants could either be undergoing treatment or have completed treatment within the last year. They had to be able to participate in physical activity (PA). Additionally, registration with the French health insurance system and having French as the primary language were required. Those who could not report weight changes in the last 6 months, individuals with disabilities preventing them from understanding study instructions, and those with medical contraindications for PA were excluded from the study.\n\nParticipants were assigned to the \"cachectic\" group if classified in categories 3 or 4 of the Martin and colleagues classification. This classification is based on two criteria: percentage of weight loss in the past six months and body mass index. Participants classified as grades 0, 1, or 2 were included in the \"non-cachectic\" group. The \"non-cachectic\" group was matched to the \"cachectic\" group based on sex, age, and number of PA sessions completed. The aim was to verify whether the recognized effects of APA in non-cachectic individuals could be transferred to cachectic participants, with matching on the compliance variable to avoid an effect related to the amount of practice. Matching tumor type was not possible, as certain tumors are almost exclusively cachectizing.\n\nSupervised Physical Activity Intervention:\n\nThe supervised PA intervention consisted of two sessions per week over a span of 12 weeks. Each session lasted one hour and was divided into 30 minutes of aerobic exercise using an ergometer (treadmill and/or bicycle), followed by 30 minutes of resistance exercises involving major muscle groups, with or without small equipment such as dumbbells, resistance bands, and balls. The exercise regimen was carried out at an intensity ranging from 50% to 70% of the heart rate reserve, with a rate of perceived exertion (RPE) set at 4 on a Borg scale of 0 to 10. A total of 24 sessions were planned. There was also the option to incorporate a 45-minute session of moderate-intensity water aerobics into the weekly routine."

This project will use a longitudinal design, following children from Kindergarten through 1st grade, to understand how the brain networks associated with reading, math, and EF interact to predict academic outcomes and, in those who struggle academically, intervention response.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This longitudinal study will be conducted with 260 Kindergartners, staggered across multiple cohorts, who are followed through 1st grade. There will be three time points of testing for each cohort: fall of Kindergarten, spring of Kindergarten, and in the fall of 1st grade.\n\nAfter the third testing time point, in the fall of 1st grade, the bottom 1/3 of readers in the sample will be selected to participate in the intervention arm of the study. These students will be randomly placed in one of two arms: business-as-usual, in which children receive no additional instruction; or the reading intervention condition, in which they receive 20 hours of 1:1 reading intervention over 6 weeks. Children in both sub-sample arms are assessed again after tutoring is complete, in the spring of 1st grade.\n\nNeuroimaging through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will occur as part of study participation in conjunction with testing at fall of Kindergarten, fall of 1st grade, and spring of 1st grade time points."
