                    "briefSummary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a very low survival rate due to its covert onset and low early diagnosis rate. This study uses a pancreatic imaging AI model to improve early detection and high-risk monitoring of pancreatic cancer through non-contrast CT scans. The goal is to validate the AI model's diagnostic performance, particularly in identifying early-stage resectable PDAC.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PDAC is one of the most aggressive malignancies, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of merely 13%. The poor prognosis is primarily due to its insidious onset and low early diagnosis rate. Clinical studies have shown that 51% of pancreatic cancer patients present with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%; in contrast, patients at stage IA demonstrate a clear therapeutic benefit, with a postoperative 5-year survival rate of up to 83.7%. Early detection of pancreatic cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. In this study, investigators will utilize our developed pancreatic imaging AI model to conduct prospective clinical trials, aiming to validate the model's diagnostic performance in real-world applications, particularly its efficacy in detecting early-stage PDAC.\n\nThis study is led by Jin Gang, Director of Department of General Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital, in collaboration with Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, The Central Hospital of Lishui City, Jingning County People's Hospital, Meinian Onehealth Health Examination Center, and the Medical AI Imaging Laboratory Team at Alibaba DAMO Academy. This is a translational study focused on early detection and high-risk monitoring of pancreatic cancer based on artificial intelligence, and it will directly impact clinical care pathways. The study population consists of individuals who have undergone non-contrast abdominal or chest CT scans at medical institutions or health examination centers, defined as an opportunistic screening population. The pancreatic imaging AI model will be used to automatically detect pancreatic lesions, including PDAC and non-PDAC subtypes. Subjects identified with positive lesions by the AI model will be required to undergo questionnaire, blood tests (including tumor marker analysis) and further imaging examinations (such as contrast CT, MRI, and EUS) to confirm the final pancreatic lesion status and formulate a treatment plan. The ultimate aim is to assess the AI model's diagnostic performance, particularly its detection rate for early resectable pancreatic cancer."

Refractory disease is defined by failure to achieve at least a partial response or disease progression within 6 months of the last therapy. Patients who initially respond but subsequently demonstrate disease progression are considered to have relapsed disease\n\nParticipant Inclusion Criteria:\n\n- To be eligible for leukapheresis, patients must have a CD19+ B-cell malignancy with relapsed or refractory disease, defined below. To be eligible for 131-I apamistamab conditioning and treatment with 19-28z CAR T-cells, patients must additionally have detectable evidence of residual malignancy at the time of assessment prior to CAR T-cell infusion (as defined below), regardless of therapy administered following leukapheresis.\n\na. Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (de novo or DLBCL transformed from an indolent lymphoma (follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia \\[Richter syndrome\\]) or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL): (\"DLBCL patients\") i. Defined as relapsed or refractory DLBCL or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) following 2 or more prior chemoimmunotherapy regimens (with at least one course including an anthracycline and CD20-directed therapy) following diagnosis of de novo DLBCL/HGBL or DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma, and requiring further treatment. Exception: patients with Richter syndrome (DLBCL arising from CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma) are eligible following 1 or more prior chemoimmunotherapy regimens (with at least one course including an anthracycline and CD20-directed therapy) and do not require a second course of chemoimmunotherapy to be eligible.\n\nii. Patients must have at least one FDG-avid (PET-avid) measurable lesion iii. Biopsy confirmation of relapsed of refractory DLBCL is required iv. For patients who have received treatment for confirmed relapsed or refractory disease otherwise meeting criteria a.i.-a.iii. as above, within 6 weeks of study enrollment, active disease does not need to be re-confirmed or present immediately prior to Screening A for the patient to be eligible for leukapheresis. However, detectable evidence of residual malignancy must be present at Screening B in order for the patient to be eligible for 131-I apamistamab and CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nb. Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or B lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis: (\"B-ALL patients\") i. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL must have been refractory to at least 1 line of multi-agent chemotherapy or relapsed following at least 1 prior multiagent systemic chemotherapy regimen that included induction and consolidation therapy ii. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL or CML in lymphoid blast crisis must have exhibited persistent disease following therapy with a second- or third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor iii. Patients must have \u22655% bone marrow involvement and/or at least one FDG-avid (PET-avid) measurable extramedullary lesion iv. For patients who have received treatment for confirmed relapsed or refractory disease otherwise meeting criteria b.i.-b.iii. as above, within 6 weeks of study enrollment, active disease does not need to be re-confirmed or present immediately prior to Screening A for the patient to be eligible for leukapheresis. However, detectable evidence of residual malignancy must be present at Screening B in order for the patient to be eligible for 131-I apamistamab and CAR T-cell therapy.\n\n* While prior CD19-targeted therapies, including CAR T-cell therapy, do not exclude participation, CD19 expression by immunohistochemical staining or flow cytometry must be confirmed prior to enrollment.\n* Age \u2265 18 years of age\n* Creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min as calculated by the Cockroft-Gault formula\n* Direct bilirubin \u22642.0 mg/dL, AST and ALT \u22643.0x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless liver dysfunction is thought to be related to underlying malignancy\n* Adequate pulmonary function as assessed by \u226592% oxygen saturation on room air by pulse oximetry.\n* Adequate bone marrow function meeting the following criteria as defined below, without requiring blood product or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support in the past 7 days, unless cytopenias are attributed to underlying malignancy in the opinion of the investigator:\n\n  1. Absolute neutrophil count \u22650.5k/\u00b5L,\n  2. Platelets \u226530k/\u00b5L,\n  3. Hemoglobin \u22657g/dL.\n* ECOG performance status 0-2.\n\nParticipant Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* ECOG performance status \u22653.\n* Pregnant or lactating patients. Patients of childbearing age should use effective contraception while on this study and continue for 1 year after all treatment is finished.\n* Impaired cardiac function (LVEF \\<40%) as assessed by echocardiogram or MUGA scan during screening\n* Patients with active graft versus host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation requiring systemic T-cell suppressive therapy are ineligible\n* Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic T-cell suppressive therapy are ineligible\n* Patients with following cardiac conditions will be excluded:\n\n  1. New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III or IV congestive heart failure\n  2. Myocardial infarction \u22646 months prior to enrollment\n  3. Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or unexplained syncope, not believed to be vasovagal in nature or due to dehydration\n  4. Any history of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF \u226420%\n* Have current or prior positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV), with the following exceptions:\n\n  1. Subjects who have positive HBV test results due to having been previously vaccinated against hepatitis B, as evidenced by negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), negative anti- hepatitis B core protein (HBc) and positive antibody to the HBsAg (anti-HBs) are not excluded.\n  2. Subjects who have antibodies to HCV or who have hepatitis B core antibody, with undetectable viremia by PCR, and with adequate organ function as defined in the protocol, are not excluded.\n* Patients with uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection are ineligible.\n* Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation or hormonal therapy, with the exception of squamous and basal cell carcinoma of skin.\n* Patients with history or presence of clinically significant neurological disorders such as epilepsy, generalized seizure disorder, severe brain injuries are ineligible.\n* Any other issue which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make the patient ineligible for the study.\n* Patients with circulating human anti-mouse antibodies to BC8 noted on initial screening (see Appendix III)\n\nSubject Inclusion Criteria for 131-I Apamistamab Infusion Patients should meet performance status and organ function parameters as specified, without known development of an exclusion criterion, prior to proceeding to 131-I apamistamab infusion.

Non-responders will be randomized to either combine resistance training with HP/protein supplement or add supervised sessions with a personal trainer (2 days per week) to the resistance training regimen.",

Selective exposure to the implanted LAL+ using the Light Delivery Device (LDD) to deliver a spatially profiled UV light produces modifications in the lens curvature resulting in a spherical or spherocylindrical power change postoperatively. A subsequent lock-in exposure is delivered to the implanted LAL+ to stabilize the lens power. The LAL+ has a modified aspheric anterior surface that creates a small continuous increase in central lens power, which is designed to slightly extend the depth of focus.",

OP-724 is intravenously administered twice a week (4 hours) for 12 weeks as an administration schedule.\n\nAt 14 days before the administration of the first cycle, the dose planned for the first cycle will be administered once by continuous intravenous administration for 4 hours, and the safety and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated from the day of administration to the day after the administration. If an integrase inhibitor is used in combination as a key drug for antiretroviral drugs, its pharmacokinetics will be evaluated at the same time.\n\nA dose escalation study with 2 doses (cohort 1: 140 mg/m2/4hr (starting dose), cohort 2: 280 mg/m2/4hr) will be conducted, and 3 patients in each cohort will be enrolled. Comprehensively investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic data after OP-724 administration, and evaluate the safety and tolerability of OP-724 administration."
