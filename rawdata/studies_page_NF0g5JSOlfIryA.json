                    "briefSummary": "Nearly 23,000 adults are diagnosed with primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy yearly. An additional 200,000 adults are diagnosed with brain metastasis. There are significant variations in CNS tumor treatment. However, due to significant heterogeneity in patient baseline factors, identifying unwarranted variation is challenging. Ghogawala et al have previously demonstrated that, among patients undergoing surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy and lumbar degenerative spinal disease, an expert panel consisting of surgeon experts can identify variations in proposed surgical procedure and demonstrated superior patient outcomes when the surgery performed matched the procedure recommended by expert consensus. Expert panel surveys have not previously been used to identify variations in care among patients with CNS malignancy.\n\nThe primary aim is to determine whether patient outcomes are superior when treatment aligns with recommendations made by a clinical expert neurosurgical panel. The study also seek to identify patient factors that predispose to variability in care. Our long-term aim is to determine whether predictive artificial learning algorithms can achieve the same outcomes, or better, as clinical expert panels, but with greater efficiency and greater capacity to be available for more patients. The investigators hypothesize that:\n\n* When a team of 10 medical experts has greater than 80% consensus regarding optimal treatment and when the doctor and patient select that specific treatment, the outcome is superior than when a patient and doctor select an alternative procedure.\n* When a team of 10 medical experts has greater than 80% consensus regarding optimal treatment, the structured data used by the experts can be processed and trained by computing algorithms to predict the pattern recognized by the experts - i.e. - the computer can predict how an expert panel would vote.\n\nProcedures include the following:\n\n1. Chart review portion of study: Patients will be identified from case logs of the principal investigators from July 2017 through July 2023. Data will be collected retrospectively and will include age, non-identifier demographics, diagnosis details, operative/treatment characteristics, post-treatment characteristics, and follow-up characteristics. Images reviewed will include pre and post-treatment MRIs obtained as part of routine care. Data will be abstracted from the medical record (Epic/Soarian and PACS) and recorded in an excel database.\n2. Survey portion of study: De-identified structured radiographic data and a brief clinical vignette without patient identifiers will be uploaded to Acesis Healthcare Process Optimization Platform (http://www.acesis.com/our-platform). A survey will be generated by Acesis and emailed to the subject experts/participants. This portion is prospective.\n3. Cohort definitions:\n\n   1. Patients will be assigned to either \"expert-treatment consensus\" or \"no expert-treatment consensus\" arms based on whether greater than 80% consensus is achieved\n   2. Patients will be assigned to either \"Expert consensus-aligned\" or \"Expert consensus - unaligned\" arms based on whether expert survey results match actual treatment given.\n4. Data will then be analyzed using appropriate packages with SAS statistical analysis software. Survival analysis will be performed to determine whether consensus predicts improved progression free survival (PFS).\n5. The structured and de-identified radiographic images used by the experts in surveys will be used for training and development of an AI algorithm. The aim of this portion of the study is to determine whether standardized and structured imaging can be used to train an algorithm to predict whether expert consensus is achieved and the recommended treatment.",
                    "detailedDescription": "1) Statistical analysis plan:\n\n1. this document provides the details of statistical analyses planned for the EC-AIM Brain study.\n2. Objective of this study:\n\ni. The primary objective is to determine whether patients whose treatment aligns with expert consensus have a superior outcome to those who treatment does not align with expert consensus.\n\n1. This will be determined with a primary endpoint of progression free survival (alive and without tumor growth at last follow up).\n2. This will be tested with the log-rank test for equality of survival curves (EC/aligned vs EC/unaligned).\n\n2) Abbreviations:\n\n1. EC - expert consensus\n2. HR - hazard ratio\n3. OS - overall survival\n4. PFS - progression free survival\n5. KPS - Karnofsky Performance Score 3) Target population:\n\na. Inclusion criteria: i. Consecutive patients treated by neurosurgeons at a single center between April 2018 and July 2023 for malignant brain tumors, including glioma, metastasis, and lymphoma.\n\nb. Exclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients without available MRI dicom images\n2. Patients with other CNS malignancies\n3. Patients with multiply recurrent gliomas undergoing treatment for primarily palliative purposes\n4. Patients younger than 16 years old 4) Sampling: Consecutive 5) Sample size assessment: a. It is challenging to determine an estimated effect size that EC would provide. From previous research on expert panels in lumbar spondylolisthesis, a sample size of approximately 200 patients was noted to be sufficient for initial assessment. As such, the study will include 225 subjects as our cohort size in order to account for \\~10% patient loss to follow up.\n\n6) Data Acquisition Methods:\n\n1. Standardized clinical vignettes with de-identified clinical data and standardized radiographic images and video will be uploaded to Acesis HPOP platform.\n\ni. Uploaded files will include representative multiplanar magnetic resonance or computed tomography images b. An email with a link to the survey will be distributed to the brain tumor expert panel c. Expert respondents will have 72 hours to respond to a standardized survey d. Expert respondents may answer questions regarding suggested treatment as well as any adjunctive technologies needed 7) Blinding: The chart review portion will be performed by a separate study investigator without knowledge of cohort assignment; cohort allocation (based on survey results and actual treatment) will be performed by a separate study investigator.\n\n8) Missing data:\n\na. All subjects will be included in primary outcome analysis. They will be censored at the last follow up assessment. All missing data will be assumed to be missing at random.\n\n9) Quality assurance plan: 10) Outcome Group Allocation:\n\na. Treatment will be defined into the following four categories: i. Observation/no treatment ii. Biopsy only iii. Resection iv. Radiation treatment b. Expert consensus will be defined as at least 80% agreement among at least 10 survey respondents c. Aligned will be defined as the recommended treatment category above matching the actual treatment provided 11) Outcome Analysis:\n\na. Primary Outcome Variable Analysis: i. The primary outcome measure is progression free survival (alive and without evidence of tumor growth at follow up) ii. Hypothesis:\n\n1. H0: hEC_aligned \u2264 hEC_unaligned\n2. HA: hEC_aligned \\&gt; hEC_unaligned iii. This will be tested with the log-rank test for equality of survival curves (EC/aligned vs EC/unaligned).\n\niv. Test will be one-sided (alpha=0.025) b. Additional analyses of the primary outcome: i. Adjustment for known confounders including diagnosis, age, KPS, extent of resection ii. Exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics and logistic regression/linear regression will be used to evaluate for interactions and confounding co-variates c. Secondary Outcome Variable Analysis: i. Overall survival ii. Data analysis will be exploratory and supportive, and, thus, the statistical plan will not account for multiplicity iii. Secondary analyses will be performed for OS and PFS for two- and three- cohort groups\n\n1. EC/aligned vs EC/unaligned\n2. EC vs no EC\n3. EC/aligned vs EC/unaligned vs no EC 12) Planned analysis for predictors of EC\n\n   1. Data analysis will be exploratory and supportive, and, thus, the study will not account for multiplicity\n   2. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate differences between EC and no EC groups\n   3. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate differences between EC/aligned and EC/unaligned groups\n   4. Fisher exact tests and Chi-squared tests will be used for categorical variables depending on test assumptions\n   5. Student's t test and Mann-Whitney U tests will be used for normally distributed and non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively\n   6. Logistic regression models will be used to evaluate for predictors of EC\n   7. Concordance between treatment performed and expert consensus will be evaluated using Spearman coefficients\n   8. All statistical tests used for descriptive statistics will be two-tailed (alpha=0.05) 13) Planned interim analysis: None 14) Adverse events: None expected as this is a retrospective chart review and survey based study."

Patients will serve as their own controls, with one block technique applied on one side of the body and the other technique contralaterally. Anatomical distribution of block effectiveness will be assessed with thermal imaging, and this distribution will be visually compared between the two techniques."

                    "briefSummary": "This study is for adults whose kidneys do not work well (renal impairment) and adults whose kidneys work normally. This study will provide more information on a potential new treatment, called ASP0367. The main aim of the study is to learn how ASP0367 is processed by the body in these different groups of people.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts. Part 2 will only happen if the results between the 2 groups are different in Part 1. In each part, people in the study will stay in a research unit for 6 days and 5 nights. Later, they will return to the research unit for 1 check-up.\n\nIn Part 1, people whose kidneys work normally and people whose kidneys work very poorly (severe renal impairment) can take part.\n\nIf Part 2 happens, people whose kidneys work normally and people whose kidneys do not work well (mild or moderate renal impairment) can take part.\n\nIn both parts of the study, people who can take part will be admitted to the research unit. The next day they will take tablets of ASP0367 just once. People will give blood and urine samples at various times during their stay. They will have their vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) checked regularly. People will also have ECGs to check their heart rhythm. They will be asked if they have any medical problems. After 6 days, provided all the checks have been done and there are no medical problems, people in the study will leave the research unit.\n\nPeople will return to the research unit for 1 check-up. This will be between 9 and 11 days after their last blood sample was taken during their previous stay in the unit. The check-up will include a physical exam, a check of people's vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure), and blood tests. Also, people will have an ECG and be asked if they have had any medical problems."

African Americans with or without Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis are eligible to join. If you agree to join the study, the investigators will ask for information about your health. The investigators will also ask you to give us a blood sample so that they may discover the genes that cause IBD. The blood sample may be collected at Johns Hopkins or any local facility convenient to you.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This current protocol was established as part of an NIDDK initiative to further explore genetic factors associated with IBD. Specifically, the investigators are interested in identifying the genetic, environment and socio-economical components that contribute to the development of IBD in the African American population.\n\nIBD is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Genetic data will be examined alongside potential environmental factors such as smoking, medications, environmental exposures, and some dietary factors. Since IBD is known to predominantly affect Western, industrialized areas of the world, the investigators will also inquire about participants' socioeconomic background in hopes of identifying any previously unknown factors in the AA population that may increase the risk of IBD. These potential environmental factors will be important in association analyses using covariates as these factors can obscure potential associations or interact with genetic factors and thus contribute to genetic associations. The investigators will also obtain information as to ancestry of parents and grandparents as to best match cases with unrelated controls of similar ancestry (e.g., Caribbean, recent European or recent African ancestry could cause genetic mismatch of a case and control). At the same time, the investigators will also collect similar information (smoking, medications, environmental exposures and dietary factors) from non-African Americans for the purpose of making direct comparisons for these parameters between the different racial groups to assess the contribution of non-genetic factors for susceptibility to the development of IBD.\n\nThis study calls for recruiting AA patients and ethnically matched controls (friend or spouse). These persons will provide us with a blood sample and with information requested on a questionnaire asking the following: clinical course and history of their IBD or their general health, smoking history, socioeconomic variables and specific dietary factors known in some populations to be related to IBD etiology. Access to medical records will be used to confirm diagnoses. The clinical characteristics of IBD obtained from medical records will be summarized in a phenotyping form using a standardized NIDDK IBDGC Phenotyping Operations Manual. Controls will be asked health history to identify potentially unrecognized IBD. DNA and other biospecimens will be purified from blood. Samples and data will also be shared with the NIDDK IBDGC for use in IBDGC research projects and will be processed and maintained at NIDDK repositories."

For Cohort G participants must have at least 1 measurable lesion, and for Part 3 (Cohorts E, F and H) participants must have at least 2 measurable lesions to safely perform mandatory pre \\& on-treatment biopsy.\n* Life expectancy greater than or equal to 12 weeks.\n* For Part 2 exclusively: While it is highly preferred to enroll subjects who are na\u00efve to PD-1 inhibitors into a Part 2 dose escalation cohort, this is not an enrollment requirement. However, subjects who enroll into a Part 2 safety expansion cohort must be na\u00efve to PD-1 inhibitors. If such subject is unable to meet this requirement but otherwise remains a good candidate for study enrollment, the Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor whether the subject may be enrolled.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate cardiovascular, hematological, liver, and renal function.\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors with at least one tumor lesion with location accessible to safely biopsy per clinical judgment of the Investigator.\n\n  * Caution: Cohort D only patients with KRAS mutant colon cancer have not typically benefitted from the addition of cetuximab in earlier lines of therapy.\n  * Caution: Cohorts E \\& F enrollment will include only patients with tumors for which anti-PD(L)1 as single agent or in combination treatments are approved.\n  * Caution: For Cohort H, the participant must have received at least one prior line of therapy for metastatic melanoma and/or does not have any standard of care (SoC) treatment option or participant declines or is intolerant to be treated with SoC treatment.\n* Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have refused SoC; or for whom no reasonable SoC exists that would confer clinical benefit; or for whom standard therapy is intolerable, not effective, or not accessible.\n* Prior anti-cancer therapy is allowed as long as any treatment related toxicity is resolved to an appropriate level.\n* Females of childbearing potential and men who are not surgically sterile must agree to use medically-accepted method of birth control during the study and for at least7 days (for Cohorts A, B, G and H), at least 2 months (for Cohort D), or at least 4 months (for Cohorts C, E and F) for females, and for at least 3 days for males \\[corresponding to the time needed to eliminate study intervention\\] after the last dose of study intervention.\n* \\[Females\\] Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiating study treatment in premenopausal women and women less than 12 months after menopause.\n* \\[Males\\] Agreement to refrain from donating or banking sperm during the treatment period and for at least 3 days after last dose of study treatment.\n* In Spain, Chile, and Argentina: Only cohorts G and H will be open to enrollment.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Radiotherapy \u2264 14 days prior to first dose of study drug (palliative radiation or stereotactic radiosurgery within 7 days prior to start of study treatment).\n* Treated with systemic anti-cancer therapy or an investigational agent within 2 weeks prior to start of study drug treatment (within 4 weeks for immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy).\n* Subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher immune-related toxicity from prior immuno-oncology therapy.\n* Major surgery \u2264 30 days prior to first dose of study drug, or has not recovered to at least Grade 1 from adverse effects from such procedure, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during study treatment.\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or have a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\n* Primary central nervous system (CNS) disease or leptomeningeal disease; known CNS metastases unless treated, are asymptomatic, are without evidence of radiological progression for at least 8 weeks, and have had no requirement for steroids or enzyme inducing anticonvulsants in the last 14 days prior to Screening.\n* Abnormal pulmonary function within the previous 6 months, including pneumonitis, active pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease requiring the use of steroids, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, confirmed pleural effusion, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy.\n* Parenteral antibiotics within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.\n* History of allogenic or solid organ transplant.\n* Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or other uncontrolled immune-related endocrinopathies in the opinion of the Investigator.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active infection with hepatitis C.\n* For known uncontrolled hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection:\n\n  i. Anti-HBV therapy started before initiation of IMP and HBV viral load \\<2000 IU/mL (104 copies/mL) are eligible. The anti-HBV therapy should continue throughout the treatment period. ii. Positive anti-HBc, positive anti HBs, negative HBsAg, and HBV virus load without HBV therapy are eligible.\n* Received a live-virus vaccination \u226414 days prior to first dose of study drug. Seasonal flu and other inactivated vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.\n* Clinically significant bleeding within 2 weeks prior to initial THOR-707 dose (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage).\n* Prior diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 3 months.\n* Severe or unstable cardiac condition within 6 months prior to starting study treatment, such as congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), cardiac bypass surgery or coronary artery stent placement, angioplasty, cardiac ejection fraction below the lower limit of normal, unstable angina, medically uncontrolled hypertension (e.g. \u2265160 mm Hg systolic or \u2265100 mm Hg diastolic), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (\u2265 grade 2, according to NCI CTCAE v5.0), or myocardial infarction.\n* History of non-pharmacologically induced prolonged corrected QT interval determined using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \\> 450 milliseconds (msec) in males or \\> 470 msec in females.\n* Known hypersensitivity or contraindications to any components of THOR-707, PEG, pegylated drugs, and E. coli derived-protein, checkpoint inhibitor, or anti-EGFR antibody for applicable cohorts.\n* Active second malignancy, or history of previous malignancy that would impact the assessment of any study endpoints. Subjects with non-melanomatous skin cancer or cervical cancer that has been curatively surgically resected are eligible.\n* Any serious medical condition (including pre-existing autoimmune disease or inflammatory disorder), laboratory abnormality, psychiatric condition, or any other significant or unstable concurrent medical illness that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude protocol therapy or would make the subject inappropriate for the study.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through for at least 7 days (for Cohorts A, B, G, and H), at least 2 months (for Cohort D), or at least 4 months (for Cohorts C, E, and F) for females and for at least 3 days for males \\[corresponding to the time needed to eliminate study intervention\\] after the last dose of study intervention.\n* Concurrent therapy with any other investigational agent, vaccine, or device. Concomitant participation in observational studies is acceptable after Sponsor approval.\n* For Cohort D only: patients with symptomatic keratitis and/or symptomatic dry eye should be excluded from enrollment. Patients who wear contact lenses should be advised to avoid contact lenses use as it could result in keratitis.\n* Subjects with baseline oxygen saturation \\<92% are not eligible for enrollment.\n* For participants in Cohort H: Participants with uveal or ocular or desmoplastic metastatic melanoma.\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to the potential participation in a clinical trial.",

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to measure the toxicity and effectiveness of the following treatments for cFIR/cgUIR prostate cancer patients.\n\nStereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) alone or Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with Ultrashort GNRH Antagonist called Relugolix (an oral drug). Treatments will be randomly assigned to study patients.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are the following:\n\n1. Whether the proportion of men who undergo SUGAR have a superior rate of attaining PSA nadir of \\<= 0.2 compared to SBRT alone, and\n2. Whether SUGAR is superior to historical rates of minimal clinically important decline (MCID) in sexual and hormonal function at 6 months for patients undergoing 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)\n\nMen aged 18+ with cFIR/cgUIR will be enrolled. Specifically, patients must meet one of the following 2 criteria: 1) Gleason score must be Gleason 3+4 with a PSA \\< 20 ng/mL, or 2) Gleason 6 (3+3) and PSA \\> 10 ng/mL and \\< 20 ng mL.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Unfavorable Intermediate Risk (UIR) Prostate Cancer is prostate cancer that is localized and curable but may require more treatment than external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone. In contrast, favorable intermediate risk (FIR) prostate cancer can be treated by EBRT alone. There is evidence that some prostate cancer that is classified through clinical factors as FIR can act more aggressively if also associated with a high risk gene expression score. This type of prostate cancer (traditionally favorable intermediate risk, but with a gene signature that predicts for aggressive disease) presents a treatment dilemma.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is generally beneficial for intermediate risk prostate cancer and so it is possible that these patients (with favorable intermediate risk based on non-genetic factors but with high genetic risk) may also benefit. However, ADT causes very bothersome side effects including hot flashes, fatigue, sexual disfunction, and in some cases, heart problems. In order to balance the benefit and harms of ADT in combination with radiation, we could reduce the length of ADT and make it precisely overlap with radiation treatment. The oral ADT medication Relugolix (Orgovyx) is ideal for this purpose. In addition to shortening ADT, it is important to measure any potential benefit when ADT is added to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). SBRT is a shorter and more intense version of standard fractionation EBRT.\n\nTherefore, a multicenter randomized phase III study comparing prostate cancer control and quality of life with SBRT + Ultrashort GNRH Antagonist Relugolix (SUGAR) vs. SBRT alone for a category of clinicogenomic unfavorable intermediate risk patients with favorable clinical features and high risk genetic features."

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational study is to develop and validate a digital ecosystem designed to assess and manage mental health in workplace environments. The primary purpose is to understand how digital tools can contribute to better mental health management and to gauge their effectiveness in a typical work setting. The study also aims to enhance the prediction of mental health outcomes and the course of mental health conditions through more accurate assessments. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. How do digital assessments improve the detection and management of mental health issues like depression and anxiety in the workplace?\n2. Can a digital ecosystem effectively reduce the overall cost and impact of mental health issues on productivity and employee well-being?\n3. How effective are bifactor models in detecting and mitigating the impact of faking in self-reported mental health assessments in occupational settings?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n1. Engage with the Metrikamind platform to complete periodic mental health assessments.\n2. Provide feedback on their experience and any changes in their mental health status, with particular attention to the accuracy and honesty of self-reported data facilitated by the implementation of bifactor models.\n3. Participate in follow-up surveys to gauge long-term effects of using the digital tools on their mental health and workplace productivity.\n\nThis study involves adult participants currently employed in various sectors undergoing a sick leave, who will use the Metrikamind platform over a six-month period. The research aims to collect data on the usability and effectiveness of the platform, analyzing changes in participants\\&amp;#39; mental health through their interaction with the digital tools provided. By incorporating advanced psychometric techniques like bifactor models, the study seeks to enhance the reliability of data and improve the prediction of mental health outcomes, providing a solid foundation for potential wider application in corporate health strategies.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Background and Rationale:\n\nMental health in the workplace is a growing concern globally, with significant impacts on productivity, employee engagement, and overall organizational health. Traditional methods of addressing mental health at work often fall short due to lack of early detection, stigma associated with mental health issues, and inadequate monitoring of interventions, but also faking good or bad due to absenteeism or presentism. The Metrikamind project aims to address these challenges by developing a robust digital ecosystem that facilitates early detection, continuous monitoring, and effective management of mental health issues within the workplace, while mitigating faking. This system leverages the latest advancements in psychometrics and digital health technologies to create a user-friendly, scalable, and scientifically valid tool that can be integrated into everyday work environments.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary objective of the Metrikamind project is to validate the effectiveness of a digital mental health assessment and management system in improving the detection, monitoring, and management of mental health issues in workplace settings. The project will evaluate how such digital tools can contribute to reducing the economic and human costs associated with workplace mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nThis observational study will utilize a longitudinal design, where participants will interact with the Metrikamind platform over a period of six months. The study will recruit adult employees from various sectors to ensure a diverse participant pool that reflects a wide range of work environments. Participants will use the platform to complete regular mental health assessments, which include both quantitative and qualitative measures.\n\nMethods:\n\nParticipants will be asked to engage with a series of assessments developed based on bifactor models, which are designed to detect and mitigate the effects of faking and social desirability bias in self-report assessments. These models improve the accuracy and reliability of mental health assessments by allowing for the separation of specific factors from general mental health constructs, thereby enhancing the precision of diagnosis and intervention.\n\nEach participant will complete a baseline assessment upon enrollment, followed by monthly follow-up assessments through the platform. The assessments will cover various aspects of mental health, including stress, anxiety, depression, and overall emotional well-being. Additional data on work performance and engagement will be collected through integrations with workplace productivity tools where available.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nData collected will be analyzed using advanced statistical techniques to determine the effectiveness of the digital platform in improving mental health outcomes. Analysis will include the use of longitudinal data analysis methods to track changes in mental health over time and to identify predictors of improvement or deterioration. Correlational analysis will also be employed to explore the relationships between mental health data and workplace productivity metrics.\n\nInnovative Components:\n\nThe Metrikamind project incorporates several innovative aspects:\n\nUse of Bifactor Models: By applying bifactor models, the project stands at the forefront of psychometric innovation, offering more nuanced insights into mental health assessments.\n\nReal-Time Data Analytics: The platform provides real-time analytics, allowing both participants and supervisors (with consent) to monitor mental health status and intervene when necessary promptly.\n\nIntegration with Work Tools: Integration with existing workplace tools and platforms ensures that the mental health management system fits seamlessly into the daily routines of employees, thereby enhancing usability and compliance.\n\nEthical Considerations:\n\nAll participants will provide informed consent before participating in the study. The study will adhere to the ethical guidelines laid out by the EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) and the Organic Data Protection Law 3/2018, ensuring the highest standards of data privacy and security. All data will be anonymized, and personal identifiers will be removed before analysis to maintain confidentiality.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\nThe Metrikamind project is expected to demonstrate the efficacy of digital tools in managing workplace mental health. It aims to provide empirical evidence supporting the integration of such tools into standard workplace practices, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how mental health is managed at work.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBy advancing our understanding of digital health applications in the workplace, the Metrikamind project promises to make a significant impact on the field of occupational health psychology, offering new avenues for promoting mental health at work."

                    "briefSummary": "This is an observational study in which data from the participants who will be taking different vitamin supplementation regimes before and during pregnancy.\n\nVitamin deficiency is a condition where there is not enough vitamins in the body. During pregnancy, a woman's body may require more vitamins than usual. When the body does not get enough vitamins, people can take vitamin supplements to help increase the amount of vitamins in the body.\n\nIt is already known, that polyvitamins can decrease risks of anemia (low level of red cells in the blood), neural tube defects (severe congenital anomaly of neural system) or other malformations, but also on several pregnancy complications.\n\nNevertheless, a significant amount of evidence on the use of vitamins during pregnancy has been obtained in countries with low and middle level of living standards.\n\nCountries with higher living standards may have different prevalence of vitamin insufficiency, thereby it is not clearly known how vitamin supplementation may help to reduce pregnancy complications in these population. So, researchers think it is important to do more studies.\n\nElevit contains many different vitamins and minerals. These vitamins and minerals are important to help women before and during pregnancy.\n\nIn this study, the researchers want to collect more data about how well pregnancies progress and the outcomes of the pregnancies in women who are taking different vitamin treatment or supplements, including elevit.\n\nTo do this, the researchers will review information collected from the participants to:\n\n* calculate how many women give birth without any complications between weeks 37 and 42 of their pregnancies\n* calculate how many women have low levels of red blood cells in the blood during the third trimester of their pregnancies\n* calculate how many women have a serious condition called preeclampsia during their pregnancy, a condition in which pregnant women have a sudden rise in blood pressure and swelling in the hands, feet and face\n* calculate how many women give birth to babies who weigh less than expected at the time of their birth\n* give the women a questionnaire to complete during each trimester to see how they are feeling\n\nThe participants will have decided with their doctor to start their vitamin treatment or supplements before getting pregnant or during their pregnancy.\n\nDuring the study, the researchers will collect the women's information from their medical records taken during their regular medical appointments. The study will include women who are pregnant and who are planning to get pregnant. The study will include both women who have vitamin deficiency and women who do not have vitamin deficiency.\n\nEach participant will be in this study for up to 18 months., The whole study will last about 2 years and 10 months. During this time, the participants will visit their doctor 5 times as part of their usual care. The study is planned to collect data from October 2021 until June 2024."

Current treatment decisions are based on subjective, qualitative assessments of the skin. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the utility of non-invasive optical spectroscopy methods to collect key biological information from neonatal skin, including skin maturity, blood oxygenation, and bilirubin content. Parents of pre-term neonatal subjects (n=44) will be recruited for consent to participate, and spectral measurements will be made with a diffuse reflectance spectrometer(DRS) device previously approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Institutional Review Board. The spectral data will be analyzed to extract parameters related to tissue light scattering, oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin, melanin, and bilirubin. The system will be validated by comparing extracted spectra with expected literature values and directly correlating the measured bilirubin levels with readouts from the current University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences practice standard: Philip's BiliChek. The long-term goal is to develop and use non-invasive optical readouts to predict and monitor skin dysfunction in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).",
                    "detailedDescription": "This is a cross-sectional, pilot study to characterize the response of neonatal premature skin to DRS when excited with a white light source, and provide a baseline of how the collected spectra change with the maturation of the epidermal layer in the weeks to term gestation after birth. DRS spectra and BiliChek measurements will be performed on the study population admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The pilot data will be used to evaluate whether Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy spectra can be used to extract optical information on skin maturity as well as hemoglobin, melanin, and bilirubin concentrations. The investigators will extract spectra for each chromophore and the relative concentration from the Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy measurements. Extracted Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy spectra will be compared to published absorbance spectra for each chromophore. The criteria for success will be a high, positive correlation (r \u2265 0.85) between the extracted Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy bilirubin concentration and BiliChek-derived concentration.\n\nThe following coded data will also be collected to investigate correlations with the Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy spectra: blood oxygen saturation, weight, ethnicity, corrected age, gestational age, sex, most recent complete blood count (if available, or partial count if not), most recent chemistry levels, lipids, liver profile, and blood gas (all if available). BiliChek measurements of bilirubin content will be compared to the extracted bilirubin contribution measured from the Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy spectra using linear regression and assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient."
