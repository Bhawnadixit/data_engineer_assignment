                    "briefSummary": "Study objectives:\n\nTo determine whether, in critically ill patients with Acute Kidney Injury requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT), randomization to receive intravenous hyperoncotic albumin 20-25% (100 mL X two doses) compared to control/placebo normal saline boluses (100 mL X two doses) given during RRT sessions, leads to:\n\n1. An increase in organ support-free days (primary outcome) at 28 days following randomization; and\n2. An increase in RRT-free days (principal secondary outcome) at 28 days following randomization.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Background: Severe Acute Kidney Injury that necessitates renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT) is a frequent complication of critical illness and portends severe outcomes: high morbidity, an approximately 50% risk of in-hospital death, and increased healthcare resource utilization. Although life-saving when needed, RRT itself may contribute to the poor outcomes associated with AKI-RRT. Since RRT treatments frequently cause hypotension, repeated episodes of kidney and other organ ischemia may occur during RRT. Hypotension during RRT is often triggered by fluid removal. At the same time, there is some evidence that more aggressive ultrafiltration could be beneficial in AKI-RRT.\n\nAlbumin is a protein that is the primary contributor to the colloid oncotic pressure maintaining the effective circulating volume (ECV) during RRT. Critically ill patients with AKI-RRT are nearly always hypoalbuminemic. Despite its high cost and limited evidence to support the practice, intravenous hyperoncotic albumin is commonly administered to patients with AKI-RRT in an effort to boost the colloid oncotic pressure and maintain the blood pressure while simultaneously facilitating fluid removal\n\nObjective:\n\nThis proposed trial is intended to provide definitive evidence as to the efficacy of a frequently used and expensive intervention to promote hemodynamic stability and augment ultrafiltration during RRT in critically ill patients\n\nDesign: A randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Setting: The mixed medical-surgical intensive care units of five Canadian tertiary care hospitals with plans to expand to include other centres across Canada and internationally.\n\nStudy Population: 856 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with AKI requiring treatment with RRT .\n\nIntervention: Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either albumin (20-25%) boluses or normal saline placebo boluses at the start and halfway through RRT sessions in ICU, during their RRT treatments to a maximum of 14 days."

                    "detailedDescription": "Introduction Intubated critically ill patients are susceptible to secretion accumulation because of compromised airway clearance. Various airway clearance interventions are employed to prevent complication arising from mucus retention. This Delphi study aims to collect global opinions on the usefulness of these various airway clearance interventions. The diverse expertise of the panel will provide valuable insights for refining airway care for intubated critically ill patients, eventually improving outcomes.\n\nMethods The steering committee, comprising of 10 healthcare professionals working in intensive care including two Delphi methodologists, performed a focused literature search on airway clearance methods and drafted statements. Statements are grouped into two distinct parts: (1) Humidification and Nebulization, and (2) Suctioning and Secretion mobilization techniques. For each Delphi part a diverse panel of 35-40 experts will be selected, with concerted effort to involve experts from various medical specialties involved in airway clearance methods inclusive of, but not limited to ICU nurses, respiratory therapists, physiotherapists, intensive care physicians. The identity of these experts will stay anonymized from each other until the end of the Delphi process. Multiple choice questions (MCQs) or 7-point Likert-scale statements will be used in the iterative Delphi rounds to reach consensus on various airway clearance interventions. Comments and feedback from experts will be collected during each Delphi round. Anonymized survey report and comments will be shared with other experts along with link for the consecutive survey. The Delphi rounds will be continued until a stable agreement or disagreement is achieved for all statements. The steering committee will not participate in the voting process during Delphi rounds.\n\nAnalysis Consensus will be deemed achieved when a choice in MCQs or a Likert-scale statement achieves \u2265 75% agreement or disagreement. Starting from the second round of the Delphi process, stability will be assessed using non-parametric \u03c72 tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Stability will be defined by a P-value of \u2265 0.05.\n\nEthics and dissemination The study will be conducted in strict accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and reported following ACCORD guidelines. An ethical approval waiver has been granted, due to the nature of the research. Participation in the study is voluntary, and completing and returning the survey will be considered as explicit consent to take part in the study. The study results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Patients' representatives will be involved to ensure their perspectives are considered throughout the research process."

A healthy gut microbiota (GM) is essential for preventing both short-term and long-term health issues. Breast milk (BM) plays a key role in establishing the GM, as, unlike formula milk, it contains miRNAs that may interact with and modulate the microbiota.\n\nPrimary Objective: To study the effect of BM on the composition of fecal miRNAs in exclusively breastfed infants compared to those fed with formula milk at different times (D10, D30, D60, M6, M12).\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nAnalyze the effect of BM miRNAs on infant fecal microbiota, taking environmental confounding factors into account.\n\nStudy the influence of BM microbiota on miRNA profiles in the milk. Examine the effect of BM microbiota on the infants' gut microbiota. Explore the links between BM miRNAs, infant gut microbiota, and intestinal inflammation.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The first 1,000 days of life are a critical period that significantly contributes to the programming of an individual's health. It is increasingly evident that establishing a healthy gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in preventing both short- and long-term health issues.\n\nAmong the factors influencing the establishment of the infant's gut microbiota, breast milk (BM) plays a fundamental role. Unlike formula milk, breast milk contains miRNAs that are potential mediators of the interactions between the host and the microbiota. Thus, we hypothesize that miRNAs from breast milk may be present in the infant's luminal content and interact with their microbiota, thereby modulating it.\n\nMain Objective: Explore the effect of breast milk on the composition of fecal miRNAs in infants.\n\nPrimary Evaluation Criterion: Profiles and quantities of miRNAs at different time points (D10, D30, D60, M6, and M12) in the stools of exclusively breastfed infants compared to those fed with formula milk.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nStudy the effect of miRNAs from breast milk on the composition of the infant's fecal microbiota, considering environmental confounding factors, including the composition of maternal microbiota.\n\nInvestigate the effect of breast milk microbiota on the miRNA profiles present in the milk.\n\nStudy the effect of breast milk microbiota on the gut microbiota of infants. Explore the links between breast milk miRNAs, the infant's gut microbiota, and intestinal inflammation in infants.\n\nSecondary Evaluation Criteria:\n\nCorrelations between breast milk miRNA profiles from D1 to D60 and the gut microbiota of breastfed infants from D1 to M12.\n\nCorrelations between the breast milk microbiota and the breast milk miRNA profiles from D1 to D60.\n\nCorrelations between breast milk microbiota from D1 to D60 and the infant fecal microbiota from D1 to M12.\n\nDirect correlations between (1) breast milk miRNAs and the measurement of fecal calprotectin in infants from D1 to D60, and (2) the infant's gut microbiota and fecal calprotectin in infants from D1 to D60.\n\nTo address the research question, we plan to include 200 mother-infant dyads. Our goal is to have 30 dyads with exclusive breastfeeding for at least two months, and 30 dyads where the infant will not have received any breast milk. Each dyad will participate in the study for a period of 12 months, and the recruitment phase will last for 18 months.\n\nAt the infant's birth, we will collect stool samples from both the mother and the infant, as well as a breast milk sample from the mother.\n\nAt 10, 30, and 60 days after the infant's birth, we will request both a breast milk sample from the mother and a stool sample from the infant.\n\nAt 6 and 12 months, only a stool sample from the infant will be collected. During each visit, a clinical research coordinator will contact the mothers to gather information about both their health and diet, as well as their infant's health and diet.\n\nAnalysis of miRNAs in Breast Milk and Stool Samples: miRNAs will be extracted from infant stool samples and breast milk using next-generation Illumina sequencing (NGS). The top 10 most abundant miRNAs will then be validated through qPCR. The overall miRNA profiles will be analyzed using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA).\n\nAnalysis of Gut and Breast Milk Microbiota: Stool and breast milk samples will be used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the microbial composition. Microbiota profiles will also be examined using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)."

Methods: 120 children with asthma in remission who were treated in pediatric outpatient department from January 2016 to October 2022 were randomly divided into experimental group and control group, with 60 cases in each group.The patients in both groups were treated with salmeterol and fluticasone inhalation powder once a day, twice a day. The patients in the control group were treated with acupoint massage on this basis. Acupoint massage once a day from Monday to Friday, lasting for 30 minutes each time.The patients in the experimental group were treated with ear point pressing beans on the basis of the control group. The ear point pressing beans is performed once a day from Monday to Friday. Changes in pulmonary function and asthma control were observed before and after treatment in the two groups were observed, and forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1),forced expiratory vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, asthma control test scale (ACT) score were compared."

Informed consent will be obtained. From patients the following information and samples will be collected:\n\n* Perioperative: Baseline health data, nutrition data, measurement body composition, glucose monitoring\n* Intraoperatively:\n\n  * Mucosal swabs\n  * Blood from central venous catheter and portal vein\n  * Mesenteric lymph node\n  * Intestinal specimen\n  * Bile\n  * Subcutaneous biopsy\n* Postoperatively:\n\n  * If a surgical site infection occurs samples from infected site"

Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and nivolumab may work better in treating endometrial cancer.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the clinical anti-tumor activity of cabozantinib s-malate (XL184 (\\[cabozantinib\\]) and nivolumab based on progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer previously treated with at least one line of platinum-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving nivolumab alone.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of XL184 and nivolumab in terms of overall response rate (ORR) compared to nivolumab alone.\n\nII. To evaluate overall survival (OS) of patients receiving XL184 and nivolumab compared to patients receiving nivolumab alone.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety of combination treatment using XL184 and nivolumab in patients with advanced, recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer.\n\nIV. To evaluate correlation between PD-L1 expression, CD3, CD4 and CD8 infiltrates and outcome (PFS, ORR, OS).\n\nV. To compare PD-L1 expression, CD3, CD4 and CD8 infiltrates in the primary tumor (archival tissue) and in the tissue from baseline biopsy.\n\nVI. To assess activity (PFS, ORR and OS) of nivolumab alone or in combination with XL184 according to microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatched repair (MMR) status.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess activity (PFS, ORR and OS) of XL184 and nivolumab in patients progressed after previous exposure to anti PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2 agents or crossed-over from single agent nivolumab, and in patients with diagnosis of carcinosarcoma.\n\nII. To compare microsatellite (MS) and MMR status, in the primary tumor (archival tissue) and in the tissue from baseline biopsy.\n\nIII. To assess the genomic and immune-markers landscape at baseline on tumor tissue and changes in immune landscape in peripheral blood during treatment and correlate with outcome.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15, then on day 1 beginning cycle 5. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and blood sample collection throughout the study and undergo biopsy at screening and optionally at follow up.\n\nARM B: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm A. Patients may cross-over to Arm A at the time of disease progression. Patients undergo CT scan, MRI, and blood sample collection throughout the study and undergo biopsy at screening and optionally at follow up.\n\nIn both arms, cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-37 days, then every 8-12 weeks."
