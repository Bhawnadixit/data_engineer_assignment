                    "briefSummary": "The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children\\&amp;amp;#39;s Fund report that exclusive breastfeeding for six months and continuing breastfeeding for two years or longer with appropriate complementary foods is one of the most powerful practices to increase the survival and well-being of the child. Some difficulties experienced during the breastfeeding process negatively affect the continuation of breastfeeding and prevent the baby from receiving breast milk. It has been determined in the studies in the literature that various interventions have been made and recommendations have been made to increase breastfeeding rates. However, it has been seen that there is a need for studies that address the needs of mothers regarding breastfeeding problems in a holistic manner and provide support in line with their needs. In order to increase breastfeeding success and ensure the continuity of effective breastfeeding, it is obvious that a holistic assessment of mothers; breastfeeding problems is needed, physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural and environmental factors that may cause deterioration in comfort are determined and comfort-focused nursing support is provided. In this context, the aim of the study is to determine the effect of the breastfeeding support structured according to Kolcaba\\&amp;amp;#39;s comfort theory given to mothers in the postpartum period on the breastfeeding comfort of mothers, and the second aim is to develop the \\&amp;amp;#34;Postpartum Breastfeeding Comfort Scale\\&amp;amp;#34; and test its validity and reliability.\n\nHypotheses of the study:\n\nH0: The breastfeeding support structured according to Kolcaba\\&amp;amp;#39;s comfort theory given to mothers in the postpartum period is not an effective method in increasing the breastfeeding comfort of mothers.\n\nH1: The breastfeeding support structured according to Kolcaba\\&amp;amp;#39;s comfort theory given to mothers in the postpartum period increases the breastfeeding comfort of mothers.\n\nH2: \"Postpartum Breastfeeding Comfort Scale\" is a valid and reliable tool for measuring mothers\\&amp;amp;#39; breastfeeding comfort.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Breastfeeding is a safe, clean, healthy and easily accessible form of nutrition under all circumstances. Breastfeeding supports the immune system of babies, reduces mortality and morbidity rates, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes in later life. Breastfeeding also has a positive effect on maternal health, reducing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Thanks to breastfeeding, bonding behavior develops between the newborn and the mother, which makes the mother feel more successful. The World Health Organization has reported that the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months should be at least 50% as the 2025 target, and this rate should be at least 70% by 2030. Despite all these benefits of breastfeeding and the recommendations of the World Health Organization, 48% of babies aged 0-5 months worldwide are exclusively breastfed. While South Asia is the region where babies are most commonly exclusively breastfed with 60% of their babies, only 26% of babies aged 0-5 months are exclusively breastfed in North America. In our country, according to the 2018 Turkey Demographic and Health Survey, only 41% of babies under six months are breastfed, and the intake of only breast milk drops to 59% in the first month, 45% in the second and third months, and 14% in the fourth and fifth months.\n\nSome difficulties experienced during the breastfeeding process negatively affect the continuation of breastfeeding and prevent the baby from receiving breast milk. In a mixed method study conducted to identify breastfeeding problems experienced in the early period, they reported that nearly 40% of mothers had breastfeeding problems in the early period and that the problems were due to lack of support from the mother-baby and health professionals. It was observed that the baby not being able to latch on to the breast (40%) and the mothers nipples being sore, injured, and cracked (38%) were the prominent problems. Conducted an observational study involving 552 mothers to investigate the breastfeeding difficulties experienced by mothers in the first months after birth and their relationship with early cessation of breastfeeding. They found that approximately 70.3% of mothers experienced problems such as breastfeeding difficulties, reporting cracked nipples, insufficient perception of milk quantity, pain and fatigue. They reported that the difficulties mostly occurred in the first month and emphasized that continuous, personalized professional breastfeeding support is very important based on the study results.\n\nIn a systematic review conducted to examine the effects of interventions on the nipple and breastfeeding in cases of flat and/or sunken nipples, which frequently cause mothers to stop breastfeeding early, it was reported that the Hoffman exercise, the reverse syringe method and nipple exercise were highly effective in increasing breastfeeding success, and that the rates of exclusive breastfeeding in the first, third and sixth months of mothers who were followed up with multidimensional visits after birth were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group. At one study emphasized that it is useful to emphasize the physical and psychological benefits of breastfeeding, as well as the health and bonding benefits, as a way to encourage more women to initiate and continue breastfeeding, and that it will be especially effective in groups that care more about body image, such as young mothers, where breastfeeding rates are low. At one study that breastfeeding mothers spend less time sleeping than non-breastfeeding mothers and that for optimal breastfeeding, the mothers paid or unpaid workload should be shared with other household members in the months after birth, thus meeting the mothers sleep needs. In a systematic review examining the effectiveness of perinatal breastfeeding support that included fathers/partners, it was determined that the inclusion of fathers in the process was associated with improved breastfeeding initiation rates and breastfeeding duration. Another systematic review suggested that there was a negative relationship between maternal anxiety in the postpartum period and the initiation and duration of breastfeeding. One study reported that exclusive breastfeeding rates increased significantly with privacy. In the presented studies, it was determined that various interventions were made and recommendations were made to increase breastfeeding rates. However, it was seen that there was a need for studies in which the needs of mothers regarding breastfeeding problems were addressed holistically and support was provided in line with their needs. It is obvious that in order to increase breastfeeding success and ensure the continuity of effective breastfeeding, a holistic assessment of mothers breastfeeding problems, determination of physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural and environmental factors that may cause deterioration in comfort and provision of comfort-focused nursing support are required.\n\nComfort in nursing practices consists of the process of defining the comfort needs of the patient, family or society, taking measures for their needs, evaluating the basic comfort level and the comfort level after the application. Kolcaba stated that comfort is a positive, holistic, multidimensional, theoretically definable and applicable concept as a result of his studies on the use of the concept of comfort in the nursing discipline. The Comfort Theory, developed by Kolcaba, is a nursing model that enables person-specific problems to be seen more systematically and to make plans for problem solving more easily. The aim of the model is to meet the physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural and environmental health care needs of the individual and to improve the comfort level and health outcomes. The taxonomic structure of the comfort theory is addressed in two stages. In the first stage, comfort levels are defined as relief, relaxation and superiority, taking into account the status of meeting individual comfort needs. Kolcaba states that when peoples needs are met, the feeling that emerges in people is relief; After the individuals needs are met, the individual will experience calmness, peace and contentment, resulting in a state of relaxation, individuals whose comfort needs are fully met will be able to overcome their problems (superiority). In the second stage, based on a holistic perspective, the dimensions of comfort are defined as physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural, and environmental. Physical comfort, includes physiological factors such as nutrition, excretion, elimination, rest, sleep, oxygenation status and pain that affect the individuals physiological state. Psychospiritual comfort, constitutes the individuals cognitive, emotional and spiritual components, and includes feelings related to being valued, self-concept and self-awareness. Environmental comfort, includes concepts related to the patients external environment, such as order, silence, comfortable objects, minimum odor, appropriate temperature, appropriate light and the view from the window. Sociocultural comfort, includes practices such as benefiting from economic support systems and providing information and consultancy.\n\nIn the literature review, positive effects of nursing care based on Kolcaba\\&#39;s Comfort Theory on care outcomes were demonstrated for adult cardiac patients, hospitalized elderly individuals, veterans, multiple sclerosis patients, adults with acute chest syndrome due to sickle cell disease, hemodialysis patients, patients in the preoperative period, breast cancer patients in palliative care, patients with cervical cancer, women undergoing hysterosalpingography, mothers who are about to give birth, mothers who have just given birth, and mothers who have had cesarean sections. In addition, it was seen that the scales named The Care in Obstetrics: Measure For testing Satisfaction COMFORTS Scale, General Comfort Scale, General Comfort Scale Short Form, Hemodialysis Comfort Scale, Nurse Comfort Questionnaire, Comfort Scale in Psychiatric Patients, Prenatal Comfort Scale, Birth Comfort Scale and Postpartum Comfort Scale were developed based on Comfort Theory. When the studies in which the Comfort Theory was used in the field of pediatric nursing were examined, it was determined that the theory was planned for; children with cerebral palsy and their parents, circumcised children and their parents, pediatric oncology patients and their mothers, newborns with Harlequin Ichthyosis, babies in the last period of their lives, children in intensive care, children in the postoperative period, children who underwent procedural procedures, interventions during labor, the mother\\&#39;s comfort and the effects on the newborn. However, the Comfort Theory was not applied to breastfeeding mothers. There is no study based on this. Kolcaba, theorist, was contacted via e-mail to get his opinion on this subject and Kolcaba gave a supportive feedback saying: I think your breastfeeding topic fits perfectly with the Comfort Theory. In addition, it was seen that there are scales called The COMFORT Behavior Scale, Premature Baby Comfort Scale, Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale and Kangaroo Care Comfort Scale in the field of pediatric nursing, but no measurement tool was found for the comfort of breastfeeding mothers.\n\nWhen the literature is examined, it is seen that various current methods are used in breastfeeding support. In three different systematic reviews, web-based breastfeeding support, one of these methods, is emphasized as effective and useful in increasing breastfeeding self-sufficiency and sustainability. Reported in n a quasi-experimental study that mothers who received Web-based breastfeeding education had higher mean breastfeeding knowledge scores and more positive attitudes towards breastfeeding than those who did not. In two different randomized controlled studies, it was noted that Web sites were frequently used by mothers and their partners for breastfeeding support and that a Web-based breastfeeding education program could contribute to the development of breastfeeding self-efficacy. When the studies conducted in our country are examined, it has been observed that breastfeeding support is provided to mothers through the WhatsApp messaging application, online education and peer support, online education and telehealth application. However, no study has been found in which web-based interactive breastfeeding support is provided.\n\nDespite many proven benefits for mothers and babies, breastfeeding rates are below the targeted rates in the world and in our country. It is clear that in order to increase breastfeeding rates, new approaches are needed to evaluate mothers holistically, to meet their individual needs that prevent breastfeeding based on scientific foundations and to support breastfeeding in this direction. In this project, determining the physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural and environmental comfort needs of mothers based on Kolcabas comfort theory to increase maternal comfort during breastfeeding, providing holistic breastfeeding support to mothers in line with their individual needs and including spouses/relatives in the support program can provide significant benefits in terms of child, mother and therefore public health.\n\nIn this context, the aim of the study is to determine the effect of breastfeeding support structured according to Kolcabas comfort theory given to mothers in the postpartum period on mothers breastfeeding comfort, and also the second aim is to develop the Postpartum Breastfeeding Comfort Scale and test its validity and reliability."

                    "detailedDescription": "This natural history study of patients with PCDH15 disease-causing variants will accelerate the development of outcome measures for clinical trials. Sensitive, reliable outcome measures of retinal degeneration will greatly facilitate development of treatments for retinitis pigmentosa due to PCDH15 disease-causing variants. Together these approaches are expected to have an impact on understanding PCDH15 related retinal degeneration, developing experimental treatment protocols, and assessing their effectiveness.\n\nThe goals and expected impact of this natural history study are to:\n\n1. Describe the natural history of retinal degeneration in patients with biallelic disease-causing variants in the PCDH15 gene\n2. Contribute to the identification of sensitive structural and functional outcome measures to use for future multicenter clinical trials in PCDH15 related retinal degeneration\n3. Contribute to the identification of populations for future clinical trials of investigative treatments for PCDH15 related retinal degeneration\n\nStudy Objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of the natural history study are to:\n\n1. Characterize the natural history of retinal degeneration associated with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the PCDH15gene over 4 years, as measured using functional, structural, and patient-reported outcome measures\n2. Explore whether structural outcome measures can be validated as surrogates for functional outcomes in individuals with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the PCDH15 gene\n3. Explore possible risk factors (genotype, phenotype, environmental, and comorbidities) for progression of the outcome measures at 4 years in individuals with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the PCDH15 gene\n4. Explore variability and symmetry of left and right eye outcomes over 4 years in individuals with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the PCDH15 gene"

Willing to participate in the study and able to communicate consent during the consent process\n2. Ability to return for all study visits over 48 months\n3. Age \u2265 8 years\n4. Not planning to enroll in an experimental clinical trial for the treatment of PCDH15 for the duration of this study\n5. Must meet one of the Genetic Screening Criteria, defined below:\n\n   * Screening Group A: At least 2 disease-causing variants in the PCDH15 gene which are homozygous or heterozygous in trans, based on a report from a clinically certified lab (or a report from a research lab that has been pre- approved by the Genetics Committee)\n   * Screening Group B: Only 1 disease-causing variant in the PCDH15 gene, based on a report from a clinically certified lab (or a report from a research lab which has been pre-approved by the Genetics Committee)\n   * Screening Group C: At least 2 disease-causing variants in the PCDH15 gene which are unknown phase, based on a report from a clinically certified lab (or a report from a research lab which has been pre-approved by the Genetics Committee)\n\nNote pertaining to all Screening Groups: if a participant has a variant(s) of unknown significance, he/she would still qualify if there is at least 1 disease-causing variant(s) on the PCDH15 gene. The Genetics Committee will review unique cases where segregation analysis is not feasible to determine eligibility.\n\nOcular Inclusion Criteria\n\nBoth eyes must meet all the following at the Screening Visit for a participant to be eligible to enroll into the genetic screening phase.\n\n1. Clinical diagnosis of retinal dystrophy\n2. Clear ocular media and adequate pupil dilation to permit good quality photographic imaging\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria at the Screening Visit in order to be eligible to enroll into the genetic screening phase.\n\n1. Mutations in genes that cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP), or presence of biallelic mutations in autosomal recessive RP/retinal dystrophy genes other than PCDH15\n2. Expected to enter experimental treatment trial at any time during this study\n3. History of more than 1 year of cumulative treatment, at any time, with an agent associated with pigmentary retinopathy (including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, thioridazine, and deferoxamine)\n\nNote: Pregnant women are not being specifically excluded from participation.\n\nOcular Exclusion Criteria\n\nIf either eye has any of the following at the Screening Visit, the participant is not eligible to enroll into the genetic screening phase.\n\n1. Current vitreous hemorrhage\n2. Current or any history of tractional or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment\n3. Current or any history of (e.g., prior to cataract or refractive surgery) spherical equivalent of the refractive error worse than -8 Diopters of myopia\n4. History of intraocular surgery (e.g., cataract surgery, vitrectomy, penetrating keratoplasty, or LASIK) within the last 3 months\n5. Current or any history of confirmed diagnosis of glaucoma (e.g., based on glaucomatous VF changes or nerve changes, or history of glaucoma filtering surgery)\n6. Current or any history of retinal vascular occlusion or proliferative diabetic retinopathy\n7. History or current evidence of ocular disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may confound assessment of visual function\n8. History or evidence of active treatment for retinitis pigmentosa that could affect the progression of retinal degeneration, including:\n\n   1. Any use of ocular stem cell or gene therapy\n   2. Any treatment with ocriplasmin\n   3. Treatment with an ophthalmic oligonucleotide within the last 9 months (last treatment date is less than 9 months prior to Screening Visit date)\n   4. Treatment with any other product within five times the expected half-life of the product (time from last treatment date to Screening Visit date is at least 5 times the half-life of the given product)\n   5. Treatment with Ozurdex (dexamethasone), Iluvien or Yutiq (fluocinolone acetonide) intravitreal implant",

                    "detailedDescription": "Gram-negative infections, particularly those caused by Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), have a dramatic impact on patient survival. Despite the introduction of new drugs in the last years have improved the outcome of patients with difficult-to-treat gram-negative infections, mortality and relapse rates are still relevant, especially in patients with high-risk sources such as pneumonia, and those in which the attainment of optimal exposure could be reduced by underlying renal disease. The use of a combination regimen in these scenarios has been proposed. However, a standardized approach to therapeutic management is still missing. To overcome this unmet clinical need, this study aims to investigate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) optimization of antibiotic dosing regimens in patients with difficult-to-treat Gram-negative infections, using Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM). A prompt implementation of an appropriate targeted antibiotic therapy could represent a valuable approach to improve clinical outcomes in patients with difficult-to-treat Gram-negative infections. Moreover, more information is needed in pediatric populations where ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) is approved only for children aged \\> 3 months (with the same indications as adults) and cefiderocol (CEF) is not approved. Indeed, cefiderocol is currently off-label administered in pediatric population using case-by-case dosages based on encouraging case reports.\n\nSince several in vitro studies have highlighted the synergistic effect of fosfomycin (FOS) with different antibiotic classes, including cephalosporins such drug could be an appealing option in combination therapy for the management of difficult-to-treat gram-negative infections, both with CAZ/AVI and CEF. However, real-life prospective studies are needed to investigate the potential benefit of combination therapy on clinical outcomes and the occurrence of further resistance. Thus, the correct dose of FOS along with the type of administration (i.e., intermittent, extended, or continuous infusion) are issues to establish.\n\nIn particular, the primary aim of the study is to evaluate the probability of achieving pre-determined pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) efficacy targets for CAZ/AVI, CEF and FOS.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\n* to evaluate the relationship between the achievement of the PK/PD target of CAZ/AVI, CEF and FOS and microbiological eradication;\n* to evaluate the trend of clinical biomarkers in response to antibiotic therapy;\n* to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of protein biomarkers.\n\nThis research is supported by EU funding within the Next Generation EU-MUR PNRR Extended Partnership initiative on Emerging Infectious Diseases (Project no. PE00000007, INF-ACT)."

Randomized clinical trial, with two intervention groups: Experimental group I will carry out training based on running on the treadmill using blood flow restriction (BFR) on match days 4 and 3 pre-competition (MD-4, MD-3). On the other hand, the Experimental II group will perform the same training without the use of BFR for 6 weeks. The study will be carried out during the 2023-2024 season in the National and Youth Honor Divisions of Spanish soccer, with soccer teams from Mallorca Island. Before and after 6 weeks of intervention, the countermovement jump (CMJ), maximum aerobic speed (MAS), VO2max, and repeat sprint ability will be evaluated. The levels of muscle soreness (DOMS) will be evaluated at MD-4, MD-3, and MD-2. The same procedure will be carried out to evaluate muscle fatigue, sleep quality, and stress through a questionnaire. Sociodemographic and anthropometric data will be collected before starting the study. In addition, the rate of exertion perceived will be evaluated at MD-4, MD-3, and MD-2.",

                    "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to test the study drug, referred to as remternetug, to determine its effectiveness for the study treatment of asymptomatic (at risk) Alzheimer disease in individuals with AD-causing mutations. This study will also investigate the effects of remternetug on biomarkers (measures of the disease including brain scans, blood and spinal fluid tests), examine safety data to identify any potential benefits or risks, and examine how well participants can tolerate remternetug.\n\nStage 1 will determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or reverses amyloid beta (A\u03b2) accumulation compared with placebo in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD).\n\nStage 2 will evaluate the effect of early anti-amyloid treatment on downstream biomarkers of AD in treated participants compared to external control groups.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function and the ability to perform activities of daily living. The amyloid hypothesis of AD postulates that the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) is an early and necessary event in the pathogenesis of AD. This hypothesis suggests that interventions that slow the accumulation of A\u03b2 plaque in the brain or increase clearance of A\u03b2 may be able to slow the progression of the AD clinical syndrome. AD occurs on a continuum from asymptomatic (preclinical) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then to dementia in mild, moderate, and severe stages. Evidence from both genetic at-risk and age at-risk cohorts, such as in dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) suggests that the pathophysiological process of AD begins well more than a decade before the clinical stage now recognized as AD dementia, and that neurodegeneration is already apparent on MRI by the stage of mild cognitive impairment. Recent clinical trial data suggest that treating AD during the earlier stages could have the greatest potential benefit on the disease by slowing progression\n\nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world.\n\nParticipants in this study will not yet have developed any clinical symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause DIAD and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Further, most mutation carriers will have levels of AD-associated amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and non-A\u03b2 biomarkers that are the same as non-carriers.\n\nAmyloid beta is a protein that accumulates in the brain of people with AD. Although we do not understand exactly what causes AD, the abnormal accumulation of amyloid beta protein in the brain is thought to play an important role in the symptoms of AD. Recent research studies indicate that amyloid beta may start building up in the brain 15 years or more before the onset of memory loss.\n\nImaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. The overall objectives of this study are to evaluate the biomarker effect, safety, and tolerability of investigational study drugs in participants who are known to have an AD-causing mutation.\n\nThe primary objective of Stage 1 is to determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or slows the rate of A\u03b2 pathological disease accumulation demonstrated by A\u03b2 PiB positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\n\nThe primary objective of Stage 2 is to evaluate the effect of early anti-amyloid treatment on disease progression by assessing downstream non-A\u03b2 biomarkers of AD (e.g., CSF total tau, NfL, MRI volume) compared to a control group from the DIAN Obs natural history study and the DIAN-TU-001 placebo-treated participants.\n\nRemternetug is a monoclonal antibody. The mechanism of action of remternetug is to target and remove aggregated amyloid plaque, a key pathological hallmark of AD, via microglial-mediated clearance. Remternetug has demonstrated the ability to reduce brain amyloid plaque.\n\nThe remternetug arm is part of Master Protocol DIAN-TU-002 (NCT05552157)"

Participant is at least 18 years old.\n3. People of childbearing potential\n\n   1. Must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (V1)\n   2. Must agree not to try to become pregnant during the study until 5 half-lives after the last dose of any study drug.\n   3. Must agree not to breastfeed from the time of signed ICF until 5 half-lives after the last dose of any study drug.\n   4. If partner is not sterilized, must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measuresfrom screening (V1) until 5 half lives after last dose of any study drug\n4. Participants must fulfill mutation status and EYO criteria:\n\n   1. Participant is a carrier of a mutation in an APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 gene that is associated with DIAD or does not know their mutation status and there is a mutation in their family pedigree that puts them at a direct risk of inheriting the known mutation;\n   2. Participant is -25 to -11 EYO based on their mutation type or family pedigree Note: If the at-risk parent is deemed a non-carrier through confirmed genetic testing at any time during the study, the participant will be withdrawn.\n5. Cognitive status of participant is normal (CDR-SB 0).\n6. Fluency in DIAN-TU trial approved language and evidence of adequate premorbid intellectual functioning. Participants must be fluent in languages for which cognitive and clinical measures have been translated and validated for use in the DIAN-TU. Fluency is generally defined as daily or frequent functional use of a language generally from birth or a young age. In cultures where multiple languages are spoken or for participants who are multilingual, determination as to whether a participant's level of fluency in languages for which clinical and cognitive measures are available meets qualification for the study should be made by the site PI.\n7. Participant has adequate visual and auditory abilities to perform all aspects of the cognitive and clinical assessments.\n8. If participant is receiving stable doses of medication(s) for the treatment of non-excluded medical condition(s) for at least 30 days prior to baseline visit (V2) except for medications taken for episodic conditions (e.g., migraine abortive therapy, antibiotics, and other medications for upper respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments).\n9. The participant has a study partner who in the PI's judgment can provide accurate information as to the participant's cognitive and functional abilities, who agrees to provide information at the study visits that require study partner input for scale completion, and who signs the necessary ICF, if applicable.\n10. The participant agrees not to donate blood or blood products for transfusion from the time of Screening (V1) for a study drug arm, for the duration of the study, and for 5 half lives after the final dose of study drug.\n11. In the opinion of the PI, the participant will be compliant and have a high probability of completing the study.\n12. The participant is able and willing to complete all study-related testing, evaluations, and procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Significant neurologic disease (other than AD) or psychiatric disease that may currently or during the study affect cognition or the participant's ability to complete the study. This would include disorders such as: recent or severe head trauma causing cognitive change, seizure disorder, neurodegenerative disease other than DIAD, hydrocephalus, cerebral/spinal hematoma, inflammatory disease, CNS infection (e.g., encephalitis or meningitis), neoplasm, toxic exposure, metabolic disorder (including hypoxic or hypoglycemic episodes) or endocrine disorder; psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depression, or any other psychiatric condition/disorder which could significantly interfere with the participant's cooperative participation (e.g., prominent anxiety, agitation or behavioral problems). Disorders that are controlled medically or remote history of these disorders (e.g., history of febrile seizures in childhood) that are not likely to interfere with cognitive function and compliance with study procedures are not exclusionary.\n2. At high risk for suicide, e.g., significant suicidal ideation or attempt within last 12 months, current major depression (as defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition \\[DSM-V\\]), or increased suicide risk based on screening Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Current stable mild depression or current use of antidepressant medications is not exclusionary.\n3. History of clinically evident stroke or history of clinically important carotid or vertebrobasilar stenosis, plaque, or other prominent risk factor for stroke or cerebral hemorrhage (including atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation, documented transient ischemic attack \\[TIA\\] in the last 12 months). Low dose aspirin (\u2264 325 mg daily) is not exclusionary.\n4. Alcohol or substance use sufficient to meet DSM-V criteria currently or within the past year.\n5. History of or Baseline visit brain MRI scan indicative of any other significant abnormality, definite microhemorrhages, evidence of a cerebral contusion, encephalomalacia, or aneurysms. Minor or clinically insignificant imaging findings are not exclusionary.\n6. Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, or foreign metal objects in the eyes, skin, or body which would preclude MRI scan.\n7. Cardiovascular complications such as uncontrolled hypertension, history of myocardial infarcts, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, long QT interval on ECG likely to interfere with participation in or analysis of the trial in the opinion of the investigator\n8. Hepatic or renal abnormalities that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with participation in or analysis of the trial.\n9. History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, history of Hepatitis B infection within the past year, history of Hepatitis C infection which has not been adequately treated or history of spirochete infection of the CNS, (e.g., syphilis, Lyme or borreliosis) or history of other infection with high risk for interfering with participation or interpretation of the study in the opinion of the investigator.\n10. History of clinically significant multiple or severe drug allergies, significant atopy, or severe post-treatment hypersensitivity reactions (including but not limited to erythema multiforme major, linear IgA dermatosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and/or exfoliative dermatitis) or sensitivity to study-drug specific PET imaging agents with a high risk for interfering with participation or interpretation of the study in the opinion of the investigator.\n11. Treatment with immunosuppressive medications (e.g., systemic corticosteroids) within 90 days prior to Baseline (V2) visit (topical and nasal corticosteroids and inhaled corticosteroids for asthma are permitted) or chemotherapeutic agents for malignancy within the last 3 years.\n12. Current clinically significant abnormalities of thyroid function, or clinically significant deficiency in vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 less than the lower limits of normal with normal methylmalonic acid (MMA)/homocysteine is not deemed clinically significant, therefore not exclusionary.\n13. Unstable or poorly controlled diabetes which the investigator believes may interfere with participation in or analysis of the study protocol. Participants may be rescreened after 3 months to allow optimization of diabetic control\n14. Morbid obesity with significant comorbidities or that would preclude MRI imaging.\n15. Current use of anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban). Daily use of low dose (\\< 325 mg) aspirin is not exclusionary.\n16. Have been exposed to a monoclonal antibody targeting A\u03b2 peptide within the past 6 months or 5 half-lives from screening, whichever is longer.\n17. Received any other investigational pharmacological treatment within 3 months of Screening or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.\n\n    Note: Use of approved treatments for AD and other medications may be permitted in this study in accordance with the guidelines in the Concomitant Medications, Section 5.1 of this protocol.\n18. Lack of sufficient venous access.\n19. Clinically relevant abnormalities in hematology, coagulation, or clinical chemistry.\n20. History of cancer that the investigator believes has high risk of recurrence and impacting study participation or analysis.\n21. Any other medical condition that could be expected to progress, recur, or change to such an extent that it could bias the assessment of the clinical or mental status of the participant to a significant degree or put the participant at special risk.\n22. Currently, or within the last month prior to screening, participated in a clinical study, including a nonpharmacological study, without prior approval.\n23. Participants with the \"Dutch\" APP E693Q mutation.\n24. Unable to fully complete baseline visit (V2) procedures with appropriate cognitive and clinical scores for eligibility\n25.

In this study, patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had not received any systematic treatment in the past will be enrolled.\n\nThe research will be conducted in two stages. In the first part, 6 patients were enrolled in the group. After the last subject in the group completed at least 21 days of observation after the first medication, the researchers will conduct a preliminary safety and effectiveness assessment. If the safety and tolerability are good, it will enter the second expansion part till the study enrolled 30 patients. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were treated with AK112 (20mg/kg, intravenous infusion, d1, Q3W) in combination with albumin paclitaxel (220mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1, Q3W) and cisplatin (75mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1, Q3W), of which the maximum treatment time of chemotherapy was up to six cycles, and the maximum treatment time of AK112 was 24 months. Patients received regular and periodic reviews, with imaging evaluations every 6 weeks.",

Plan to enroll 6 advanced ESCC subjects who have not undergone any systematic anti-tumor treatment in the past. After completing at least 21 days of observation after the first medication of the last enrolled subject, the researchers will conduct preliminary safety and efficacy evaluations. If the safety and tolerability are good, and preliminary therapeutic signals are observed, it will enter the stage of expansion into the group. Researchers may also discuss adjusting the AK112 dose, albumin paclitaxel dose, or cisplatin dose based on the specific situation during the DLT observation period, and then enroll new subjects for the safety introduction phase evaluation of the treatment plan in the study group.\n\nDLT definition: Within 21 days after the first administration, the subject experiences the following drug-related toxic reactions (according to NCI CTC AE 5.0 toxicity evaluation criteria): hematological toxicity level 4 or above or non hematological toxicity level 3 or above (excluding hair loss).\n\nPart 2: Expand the enrollment stage, to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK112 combined with albumin paclitaxel and cisplatin in first-line treatment of advanced ESCC. During the expansion phase, 30 subjects will be enrolled, and a comprehensive discussion will be conducted based on the safety and efficacy data from the safety introduction phase to determine the dosage."
