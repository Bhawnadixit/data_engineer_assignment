The etiologies are multiple but the diagnosis of the causative disease is sometimes difficult and the treatment is not completely codified.\n\nThe research focuses on the characterization of TIN on the etiological, clinical, biological, therapeutic and prognostic levels in order to improve patient care.\n\nFor this purpose, kidney biopsies performed for the diagnosis, kept in a biological collection within the biological resource platforms of the Necker-Enfants Malades hospital and the Georges Pompidou hospital will be centrally reviewed, blinded to the final diagnosis.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is defined as a diverse set of renal pathologies caused by a primary lesion of the interstitial compartment, which most often extends to the associated tubular structures. Renal histology establishes the diagnosis by objectifying different types of lesions associated to varying degrees depending on the etiology and clinical course. These lesions are: an interstitial inflammatory infiltrate whose nature is largely dependent on the etiopathogenic mechanisms of the lesion, diffuse or multifocal interstitial fibrosis, tubular epithelial lesions in the form of tubulitis and/or tubular atrophy.\n\nResearch focuses on the characterization of TIN on the etiological, clinical, biological, therapeutic and prognostic levels in order to try to improve patient care. For this:\n\n* 1st step: native kidney biopsies performed to establish the diagnosis and kept in a biological collection within the biological resource platforms of the Necker-Enfants Malades hospital and the Georges Pompidou hospital will be centrally reviewed The review will be performed at the Pathology department of Necker hospital, blinded to the final diagnosis for selection of the biopsies that will be included in the study. Included biopsies will be those with tubulointerstitial nephritis retained as the main cause of renal dysfunction after etiological investigation\n* 2nd step: collection of clinical and biological data regarding the diagnosis, management and prognosis\n* 3rd step: statistical analysis of the data and consolidation of the results."

Some studies have suggested that the healthy newborns with hyperbilirubinemia outside the physiological range have notably reduced serum vitamin D levels. This deficiency is inversely associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting that low vitamin D levels could be a potential risk factor for jaundice among neonates."

Participants include newly diagnosed patients with OSA who are candidates for CPAP treatment and their partners. The couples will received supportive information and resources on their mobile devices before CPAP begins and continuing for 6 months into CPAP treatment. Their interaction with the resources is self-paced and the time sent engaging with the information is up to them. Participants will be asked to answer questions independently at five points: before CPAP, and after using CPAP for 1-week, 1-month, 3-months and 6-months. Those questions are about their experience of using CPAP, how the partner is involved in CPAP treatment, and symptoms and quality of life. At the end of the study, some couples may be contacted for a virtual discussion about your experience regarding study participation which lasts approximately 1 hour."

The main objectives it aims to answer are:\n\n* To evaluate the effect of pre-emptive antibiotic prophylaxis on clinically relevant OSIs in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile\n* To evaluate the effect of pre-emptive antibiotic prophylaxis on other postoperative outcomes (e.g. OSIs, superficial SSIs, POPF, PPH, major morbidity, ICU admission, readmission, length of hospital stay, and mortality).\n* To evaluate concordance between perioperatively obtained bile cultures and postoperative cultures from infectious sites, and to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity patterns of the cultured microorganisms.\n\nParticipants will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation before surgery into the intervention or control group:\n\n* Patients in the intervention group will receive perioperative prophylaxis (similar to the control group) followed by five days of 1500mg IV cefuroxime and 500mg IV metronidazole thrice daily.\n* Patients in the control group will only receive perioperative prophylaxis (a single dose of 5-7mg/kg gentamicin followed by 2gr IV cefazolin and 500mg IV metronidazole every 4h of surgery), which will be discontinued after surgery.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Rationale: The additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment after pancreatoduodenectomy is undetermined as previous research reported conflicting results regarding infectious complications. Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis (formally pre-emptive antibiotic treatment) after pancreatoduodenectomy might reduce the rate of surgical site infections in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile (predominantly patients with preoperative biliary drainage or an ampullary malignancy). Current national and international guidelines lack clear recommendations regarding pre-emptive antibiotic treatment leading to substantially varying antibiotic prophylactic regimes between institutes.\n\nObjective: This trial evaluates the additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment on clinically relevant organ/space surgical site infections (OSIs) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile.\n\nStudy design: This multicenter, randomized controlled, superiority trial compares perioperative versus pre-emptive antibiotic treatment during five postoperative days after pancreatoduodenectomy in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile.\n\nStudy population: Adult patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile (patients with preoperative biliary drainage or an ampullary malignancy). Patients with a contraindication for the study antibiotics or a preoperative indication for antibiotics (e.g. cholangitis of preoperative abscesses) are excluded.\n\nIntervention: Participants will be randomized to either perioperative prophylaxis (cefazolin, metronidazole and a single dose of 5-7mg/kg gentamicin, control arm) or additional cefuroxime and metronidazole for five postoperative days (experimental arm).\n\nMain study endpoints: The primary endpoint are organ/space infections (OSIs) within 90 days after surgery requiring a therapeutic intervention. Secondary endpoints are OSIs, isolated OSIs, wound infections, postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile or enteric anastomotic leakage, post pancreatectomy hemorrhage, delayed gastric emptying, bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo \u2265III), reintervention, ICU admission, length of hospital stay, readmission, and in-hospital and 90-day mortality. Besides, switch of postoperative antibiotics, antibiotic sensitivity patterns and concordance between perioperative bile and postoperative surgical site cultures are analyzed.\n\nSample size: The sample size is calculated for superiority to achieve an OSI difference of 15% (40% vs 25%). With a 80% power (1-\u03b2) and a two-sided significance level (\u03b1) of 5.0%, a sample of 304 evaluable patients is required for superiority. Assuming a 3% non-resection rate due to metastatic disease and a 3% loss-of-follow-up rate, an expected number of 322 included patients are needed to reach the sample size of 304 evaluable patients to demonstrate superiority for the intervention."

                    "detailedDescription": "Self-regulation (SR) skills in early childhood predict later academic achievement and protect against developing internalizing and externalizing problems such as depressive symptoms or aggressive behavior (McClelland et al., 2019; Robson et al., 2020). One way to target SR skills is to use a program that involves motor synchrony games (e.g., musical freeze) (Gibb et al., 2021; McClelland et al., 2019; Zelazo et al., 2018). This study seeks to implement a similar motor synchrony games protocol in mixed ability groups to target SR. The investigators plan to use a multiple baseline design, a type of single case experimental design, to characterize the growth for individual participants.\n\nThe specific aims are as follows:\n\nAim 1: To determine if targeted motor synchrony games can achieve an increase in SR.\n\nAim 2: To examine how individual participants, including those with and without disabilities, respond to the protocol.\n\n(Protocol modified in October:) Aim 3: Determine if hurricane Helene impacted the self-regulation of participants\n\nSchedule: During the study, participants will begin baseline procedures twice a week for (approximately) 6, 9, 12 sessions (12 session group must have 3 sessions post-hurricane Helene). Afterwards, the participants will start the intervention. During baseline and intervention, the investigators measure their completion of a progressively more challenging stop and go task and imitations as the repeated measure. This procedure reflects a multiple baseline design.\n\nAs an exploratory analysis, all enrolled participants will complete assessments at 5 times: initial time point, before starting intervention, after hurricane Helene, after intervention procedures complete, and 2 months follow-up. (Post-hurricane data point was added due to the \\~3 week shut down that disrupted the study in October. Parents could opt-out of these specific procedures.)\n\nIntervention procedures: In the intervention period, participants will join the investigators in intervention sessions that last approximately 20-25 minutes and will involve rhythm and motor games or activities. All games are designed to have aspects of synchronous movement but should be fun and developmentally appropriate.\n\nFollowing completion of the intervention, the investigators will graph the results for visual inspection of the stop and go and imitation data. The investigators also will calculate Tau-U statistics (including correcting for baseline trend).\n\nThe investigators plan to use the other assessment measures in two ways: the investigators will use an ANOVA to determine if there were significant differences between assessment time points. The investigators also will use a regression to account for the actual time that has passed."

                    "briefSummary": "The last 15 years the introduction of primary angioplasty has radically improved outcomes for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the system wide availability of prompt investigation has revealed an important group of patients where progress has stalled, the diagnosis is unclear and therapeutic approaches are uncertain. Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is found in 1 - 13% of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of AMI.\n\nThese patients present a therapeutic predicament since coronary revascularization is not appropriate. Guidelines do not exist for their management - yet the condition is not benign - the 12-month prognosis, although better than obstructive coronary artery disease patients is still guarded with recent data suggesting many questions remain unanswered.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This study utilises a prospectively collected clinical database. All patients referred to the Interventional Cardiology team are included onto this database. No patients will be contacted solely for research purposes. Patients will not have any investigations/procedures performed for research purposes. All data will only be available for access by named members of the Interventional Cardiology team. Data will be anonymised by the clinical care team and passed onto the research team before it is used and no patient identifiable information will be used in the analysis of the study or the publications of its results.\n\nThe database started in April 2015 and has collected data on all patients so far and will continue to do so for the duration of clinical work by the Interventional Cardiology team. As a result this study will continue indefinitely.\n\nThis study will include all patients admitted to or reviewed in clinic at Barts Health NHS Trust with either a diagnosis of MINOCA or who do not have a clear cause of a troponin rise. These patients range from young adults to the elderly and will include any patient \u226516 years of age. Patients who are followed up with and without any intervention (i.e. both medically managed patients as well as patients undergoing intervention) are equally as important and therefore the investigators shall include both groups of patients.\n\nPatients will be included from referrals made by other clinicians either as in or outpatients. All these patients have their clinical data captured on a database or hospital based clinical programme.\n\nThis study aims to assess, in a real-world setting, the safety, efficacy and feasibility of further investigations in patients diagnosed with MINOCA among all patients with coronary artery disease.\n\nThe study will test various hypothesis including but not limited to:\n\n1. The efficacy of diagnosis rates of CMR in patients diagnosed with MINOCA\n2. Outcomes in patients diagnosed with MINOCA treated medically\n3. Long-term outcome of patients diagnosed with MINOCA"

                    "detailedDescription": "R61 Phase (Intervention adaptation): The TBRI intervention will be strategically adapted for CLS-involved women during the R61 to achieve 2 specific aims: 1) Adapt TBRI by focusing on adapting two intervention components - prison group sessions and re-entry recovery support - using focus groups with key stakeholders (N=30) including administrators, practitioners, and women with \"lived experience,\" and target alignment with the unique treatment needs of the women and establish intervention approach feasibility; and 2) Pilot test the adapted intervention components in one group of women (n=8) at the KCIW facility. Final adaptations will be made to the TRUST manual for the R33 implementation.\n\nR33 Phase (Intervention testing): The R33 will test the effectiveness of the adapted TBRI-WRA to reduce overdose risk in the community following prison release, while also collecting data on key constructs hypothesized to influence successful intervention implementation. The primary aim of the R33 is to examine effectiveness of the adapted TBRI Women's Re-entry Approach (TBRI-WRA) in reducing overdose risk among women (N=264) in four sites following release from prison-based SUD treatment. Study conditions include (1) Treatment as Usual (TAU, standard in-prison SUD treatment, n=88), (2) In-prison TBRI (TAU + TBRI prison-based sessions only; n=88), and (3) TBRI + Re-entry Recovery Support (TAU + prison-based TBRI sessions + Re-entry Recovery Support; n=88). The R33 will also examine implementation factors associated with study preparation, launch, sustainability, and scalability."

The original TBRI approach includes a focus on group skills training; similarly, it is anticipated that R61 phase adaptations will meet the need for tailored skills training reflected by anticipated differences in the target population of women - including how their early attachment and trauma histories influence their current self-image and behavior (which likely has a tremendous impact on their relational attachments as adults). Group sessions will provide opportunities to build skills for regulating emotions and building healthy connections.",
