Objectives: 1) To compare biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in plasma samples from patients with Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and without OSA. 2) To determine if CPAP reduces biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in plasma samples.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Randomized, parallel group, non-blinded, controlled clinical trial compared with conventional treatment.\n\nA. Protocol and intervention Patients with an Apnea-Hypopnea index (AHI)\\>30 h-1 will be assigned, using a 1:1 randomization table, to lifestyle recommendations treatment or to lifestyle recommendations plus nasal CPAP, for a period of 4 months. CPAP pressure will be titled with automatic using an AutoSet II device, ResMed.\n\nB. Sample size For the estimation of the sample size, previous data were used (PLoS ONE 2019;14(9): e0221255). In this case, in order to compare the effect of CPAP it would be necessary to randomize a total of 100 patients with OSA and 30 control subjects.\n\nC. Ethical considerations\n\n* Indication of CPAP treatment for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease is not yet accepted.\n* Those patients with an urgent study indication for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory sleep disorders (professional drivers, respiratory failure or risk professions) will be excluded from the project. In the other cases, the delay in healthcare for the performance of Polysomnography and CPAP titration exceeds the duration of the study, therefore that patients assigned to the control arm (conventional treatment) will not be exposed to a higher risk than the general population.\n\nD. Methods.\n\n. Polysomnography. It will be used as a screening test previous the randomization of the included patients. The exploration and its interpretation will be carried out following the recommendations of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Based on the results of this test, only those patients with an AHI will continue in the study when AHI \\>30 h-1. In these patients the determinations listed below will be carried out immediately before randomization (visit 1), at 4 weeks (visit 2), 16 weeks (visit 4) of allocation to the corresponding treatment group\n\n* Clinical data: The medication used and other associated diseases already diagnosed will be recorded.\n* Vital signs: recording of blood pressure, by means of a conventional triple taking, and heart rate.\n* Anthropometric characteristics: age and weight in basal conditions, the perimeter of the neck and waist / hip index will be measured. The lean mass index will be determined using a Bodystat 1500 impedance system (Bodystat Ltd, United Kingdom).\n* Questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale, generic health-related quality of life (SF-12 and EuroQoL) and daily physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire or iPAQ).\n* Laboratory findings: blood count, coagulation, creatinine, serum sodium and potassium; glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood glucose and insulin levels in fasting, from these values will determine the resistance and sensitivity to insulin using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) indices; total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides; and troponin I, homocysteine, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) and highly sensitive C-reactive protein.\n* Blood venous samples. 20 mL of venous blood will be collected, storing the plasma obtained at -80 \u00baC for subsequent determination of \u03b2 amyloid biomarkers (A\u03b240, A\u03b242, tau y tau 181 (P-tau 181).\n* Night pulse oximetry. To assess the existence of residual nocturnal hypoxemia.\n* In the patients assigned to the CPAP treatment arm, a count of the hours of use of the CPAP will be carried out at each visit by directly reading the automatic counter of each equipment.\n\nStatistic analysis The data will be expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median (interquartile range) or percentage, depending on their type and distribution. For comparison between groups Student's t-test, the U-Mann-Whitney or the chi-square test will be used, as appropriate. The relations between variables will be analyzed using Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. The effect of treatment will be evaluated using general linear models and repeated measures analysis of variance, with multiple comparisons post-hoc using the Bonferroni test. A multiple logistic regression model will be applied to determine the related variables with a response to treatment. Values of p \\<0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The statistical study will be performed with the SPSS program version 22.0."

In addition, this study will include a sequential dose exploration part to identify the RP2D of AMG 701 in combination with pomalidomide, with and without dexamethasone (AMG 701-P+/-d). Phase 2 will consist of the dose-expansion part to gain further efficacy and safety experience with AMG 701 monotherapy in adult subjects with RRMM."

However, due to the complex interaction between the immune system and tumors, there is still a lack of effective markers for immunotherapy. Scientists are actively searching for and developing new immunotherapy markers. For cervical cancer diagnosis, it has been shown that ctDNA mutations can reflect HPV integration sites. In terms of cervical cancer prognosis monitoring, cohort studies focused on the application of HPV ctDNA in the field of cervical cancer prognosis monitoring. The aim of this study is to design a customized ctDNA probe for cancer patients through a priori tumor detection method, and to guide recurrence monitoring plan and implement individualized adjuvant therapy according to the results, and to explore personalized biomarkers to guide cervical cancer immunotherapy. To explore the possibility of customized ctDNA detection as a diagnostic marker for cervical cancer. To explore the predictive and prognostic value of customized ctDNA dynamic monitoring. A multi-arm cohort clinical study is planned. To comprehensively study the treatment strategy of advanced and recurrent cervical cancer and explore the related biomarkers through the customized dynamic monitoring of ctDNA in patients with advanced and recurrent cervical cancer. A total of 60 patients with cervical cancer were enrolled."

Investigators researched the transition rate to surgery and the following factors: 1. Patient background, 2. Time from onset to hospital visit, 3. Vital signs and inflammatory findings on arrival, 4. CT findings of duodenal ulcer perforation and degree / shape of liver coverage for the perforation, and the extent of ascites."

                    "briefSummary": "The study aims to test the efficacy of a CBT-enhanced text message intervention and a supportive text message intervention to reduce symptom burden in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and co-occurring hazardous drinking.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This study will test a previously piloted and refined text message intervention by comparing a CBT text message intervention to supportive messages condition for reducing hazardous drinking (HD) and PTSD symptoms. The intervention will be tested in a fully powered two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a text message intervention (3 texts/week based on CBT skills) to supportive texts. A sample of 333 participants with DSM-5 Criterion A trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and HD will be enrolled and randomized to condition. Baseline, post-, 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month assessments will capture change in primary outcomes (PTSD, hazardous drinking) long-term. Weekly assessments will be given to both conditions to understand shorter-term patterns of symptom change associated with the interventions.\n\nEligible participants will be individually randomized by the Study Research Coordinator to one of the two conditions. For those in the intervention condition, participants will receive three text messages presenting a CBT skill followed by framing and growth mindsets (sent on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday). They will also be asked to complete weekly self-reports on PTSD and HD every Monday following their first week of text messages. The supportive messages only group will be sent three short supportive messages, timed to correspond with the CBT skill group, and will be asked to complete the weekly self-reports on PTSD and HD every Monday for four consecutive weeks.\n\nPrimary measures include measures assessing inclusion criteria and main outcomes. Primary measures are given at screening/baseline and all follow-ups unless otherwise noted.\n\nDemographics including age, race/ethnicity, gender, income/work status, weight (for BAC calculation for safety monitoring), verification of cell phone ownership and willingness to receive messages, certification of English fluency, and current residential zipcode (to verify WA State residency) will be assessed at screening only.\n\nTrauma exposure and PTSD symptoms will be assessed using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Civilian Version DSM-5 with the Life Events Checklist (PCL-5 and LEC).\n\nHD will be assessed via a set of measures that provide a detailed picture of drinking patterns. First, two questions will ask about heavy episodic drinking (HED: 4/5 or more drinks per single occasion for men/women) episodes, assessing both frequency over the lifetime and frequency over the last month. Typical weekly alcohol consumption will also be assessed using the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ). Negative alcohol-related consequences will be assessed via the Short Index of Problems (SIP).\n\nSecondary measures include those assessing secondary outcomes. Unless otherwise noted, secondary measures are given at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. They include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Customary Drinking and Drug Use Record (CDDR), the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) and the Treatment Services Received (TSR).\n\nAnalyses will compare conditions to test effect sizes between the two conditions (text message intervention vs supportive messages). The sample size was selected based on power calculations for detecting a small effect between conditions and also to allow for testing of a-priori chosen effect modifiers (race, gender, trauma type, CBT skill use)."

Clinical data and specimens will be collected from subjects with objective evidence of dry eye who were or were not diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome at the time of their initial participation in the SICCA study. Specimens will be collected from participants which will include tears, saliva, whole blood, serum, DNA and possible labial minor salivary gland biopsies when indicated. All individuals will participate in a standard evaluation protocol including an oral, ocular and physical examination, objective tests for dry eyes and dry mouth and, whenever necessary, a labial minor salivary gland biopsy. The biopsy requirement is waived for those who have already had positive lip biopsies in the past.",

Objective evaluation of salivary function will be done by collecting unstimulated whole and stimulated parotid saliva. Objective evaluation of lacrimal function will be performed using the Schirmer test I, Lissamine Green staining, and determining tear break-up time. In a subset of patients, when indicated an objective evaluation of lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands will be performed by histologic analysis of labial salivary gland biopsies. Serum autoantibody profiles will be determined. In addition, specimens such as biopsies, saliva, sera, conjunctival cells, and tears will be collected. Standardized questionnaires will be used to gain health information."

In this study, the researchers will use a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel method to recruit Alzheimer's disease patients to confirm the efficacy and safety of Wei Li Bai capsules. Confirmation of drug efficacy will be observed through changes in Alzheimer's disease patients' general cognitive function scores, scores of different cognitive domains, daily living activities, and symptom severities.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Wei Li Bai Capsule is composed of sodium ferulate tablets, L-rhamnose and chrysin. Sodium ferulate tablet is a domestically marketed drug, L-rhamnose is a marketed food additive, and chrysin is a dietary supplement. All of them have been widely used and their safety has been confirmed. In addition, since these three compounds all show good potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and play an important role in regulating metabolism, improving blood circulation and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, this study will explore the synergistic effect of Wei Libai capsule in patients with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease in 130 subjects."

There is a need for effective treatments of depression and there is a need to make sure that the treatments that are given are based on scientific findings. In this study the investigators want to examine and compare two common treatment models for depression - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Emotion-Focused Therapy. The investigators want to investigate what characterizes these treatments when they are successful, and seek to better understand what it is like for patients to receive these treatments. Also, the investigators will investigate the experience of patients who abruptly discontinue treatment. To investigate these questions, self-report measures, interviews and analysis of session recordings will be used.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Depression is a widespread mental disorder which can result in severe impairment and reduced quality of life for those affected. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the approach with strongest empirical support, and is often recommended as treatment for depression, as in the NICE Guidelines for Depression from 2009. However, research indicates that not all patients respond to CBT, indicating a need to expand the range of available evidence-based psychotherapies, and mapping the mechanisms of change in existing treatments.\n\nEmotion focused therapy (EFT) is one promising treatment for depression with empirical support for its efficacy. A previous study found equal outcome in CBT and Process-Experiential treatment/EFT for depression, but more studies are needed to replicate these findings across cultural contexts. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether there are significant differences in the therapeutic effect of EFT compared to that of CBT for patients with moderate and major depressive disorder in a Norwegian outpatient setting.\n\nAlthough several psychotherapeutic approaches have shown efficacy in the treatment of depression, no psychotherapeutic interventions is beneficial for all patients. There is a need for research that investigates what treatments works for whom, based on patient characteristics and preferences. The present study will investigate whether patient characteristics moderate treatment outcome, both within and between treatment conditions. In addition, qualitative interviews will be conducted to get a deeper understanding of what clients find helpful and challenging within the CBT and EFT condition, and to explore the experience of patients who drop-out of the treatment process.\n\nIn order to further develop psychotherapeutic treatments and increase their effectiveness, there is a need to identify processes that are related to good and poor outcome. Process-outcome studies are commonly used for this purpose. The present study will investigate and compare characteristics of psychotherapy processes in both the CBT and EFT conditions and how these are related to outcome.\n\nStudy design and Method\n\nThe study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in order to compare the efficacy of EFT to CBT. RCT's are considered the gold standard for efficacy studies. Participants will be recruited from the Norwegian mental health program \"Return to work\", a publicly funded treatment program where patients with common mental health issues receives outpatient psychotherapeutic treatment to reduce and prevent sick leave.\n\nThe present study will address the following research hypothesis and questions:\n\n1. EFT and CBT will not result in significantly different outcome in the treatment of patients with moderate and major depressive disorder.\n2. Patient characteristics (severity of depression, adverse childhood experiences and clients' initial ability to make sense of their experience) will moderate treatment outcome for both conditions.\n3. Will therapeutic processes (therapeutic alliance, therapist empathy, clients' ability to make sense of their experience and emotional processing) mediate treatment outcome equally for both conditions?\n4. What do patients in both conditions describe as helpful and unhelpful aspects of treatment?\n5. How do patients in both conditions describe their own change or lack or change after treatment?\n6. How do patients that choose to drop out of treatment describe the processes leading to that decision?"
