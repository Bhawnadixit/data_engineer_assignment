A ketogenic diet is one that is very low in carbohydrates (simple and complex sugars). The goal of this diet is for the body to go into a state of ketosis. Ketosis is when the body does not have enough sugar for energy so it burns stored fats which create acids called ketones, which can be used for energy. Researchers hope to learn whether or not a ketogenic diet is well-tolerated and safe to eat before surgery in endometrial cancer patients."

                    "briefSummary": "Amblyopia, or 'lazy eye', is the reduction in vision usually in one eye, due to abnormal visual development without organic cause. It is a preventable and leading cause of monocular vision loss (prevalence of around 3%) and increases lifetime risk of bilateral visual impairment from 10% in the general population, to 18% in amblyopes.\n\nIn the UK, vision screening in children aims to detect amblyopia and other undiagnosed visual conditions. Laboratory research suggest that amblyopia could be better detected by modifying standard clinical vision tests to enhance and quantify \"crowding\". Crowding is the negative effect that surrounding features have on the visibility of a target. Crowding distance and crowding magnitude are considerably greater in amblyopic eyes than in normal healthy eyes. Modifications that should lead to improved amblyopia detection are 1) place letters closer together on a vision chart, 2) define letters by contrast, rather than luminance, and 3) use a new thinner font in the form of numbers, to allow crowding distance in central vision to be measured. In this project, these modifications will be tested in amblyopic children for the first time.\n\nAmblyopic children aged 3 to 11 years (n=32) will be recruited from ACPOS (Addenbrooke's Community Paediatric Ophthalmology Service) at ARU. They will have their vision measured with the three modified tests as well as an uncrowded test. The child will view letters and numbers on a computer screen and respond (verbally or by indicating their choice on a matching card). Testing is fun and game-like with breaks for rewards. Results will be compared to standard vision measurement (SLT: Sonksen LogMAR Test) from the child's ACPOS visit. Amblyopic data will be compared to control data from normal healthy children aged 3 to 11 years (n=200), and age-matched children with normal vision (n=16) from ACPOS (false referrals from school screening).",
                    "detailedDescription": "In the UK, a national vision screening is employed to detect amblyopia and other undiagnosed visual conditions in school-aged children, so that they can be managed effectively. Better detection of amblyopia could be achieved by modifying current visual acuity tests, which measure the spatial resolution limit (or capacity for clarity and sharpness) of vision and by measuring crowding distance; previously unmeasured in a clinical setting. By strengthening crowding magnitude, and better quantifying its spatial distance in paediatric populations, it is hoped that the ability to detect amblyopia, and monitor its improvement with treatment will be significantly enhanced.\n\nThree recent suggestions regarding modifications to current visual acuity tests may lead to improved detection of crowding-sensitive conditions, such as amblyopia. First, closer placement of surrounding letters to the target letter should increase the magnitude of crowding in the amblyopic eye in particular, leading to increased visual acuity differences between eyes. Second, contrast modulated stimuli should enhance crowding in amblyopic eyes. Third, a new thinner font will allow clinical measures of foveal crowding distance. In this project, these three modifications will be tested for the first time in the target clinical population.\n\nSeveral studies reported that optotypes (letters or symbols) on a vision chart should be placed closer together than they currently are on commercially-available charts, which use 2.5 to 5 stroke-widths separation between target and neighbouring letters. Closer placement disrupts target optotype identification in normal peripheral vision and in central vision of amblyopic eyes due to crowding. In one vision test in the proposed study, a laterally-reversible target letter (e.g., H, O, T or V) will be surrounded by four other letters (U, A, L, C). This arrangement, in which letters were separated by 0.5 optotype widths (or 2.5 stroke widths) was first formally used in the Cambridge Crowding Test. In the proposed experiments, the surrounding letters will be placed 1 stroke-width away from the target letter, the optimal position recommended by recent studies.\n\nVisual acuities for target letters will be measured for both amblyopic and non-amblyopic eyes of child participants, in a clinical environment. These results will be compared with visual acuities acquired during the clinical appointment using the Sonksen logMAR Test (SLT), which is the standard visual acuity test used in Cambridge University Hospital, Addenbrooke's Orthoptic Department\n\nIn the Sonksen logMAR Test (SLT), a single line of 4 letters separated from each other by 5 stroke-widths (or 1 optotype width), is contained within a box, separated from the letters also by 5 stroke-widths.\n\nRecognition of target optotypes created by contrast-differences (second-order stimuli) is prone to greater crowding effects than is recognition of optotypes created by luminance-differences (first-order stimuli). This effect is present in normal vision, however even greater visual losses for contrast-defined targets, as well as stronger crowding effects, have been reported in amblyopia. By presenting a contrast-modulated (CM) target letter (H, O, T or V) surrounded by four other letters (U, A, L, C) placed 1 stroke-width away (in the modified Cambridge Crowding Test arrangement), this research aims to examine whether this second-order vision test will exaggerate differences between the eyes of amblyopic children, when compared to those measured in visually 'normal' children. The results will again be compared to those obtained with the Sonksen logMAR test (SLT), a first-order vision test, to compare their sensitivities to amblyopia detection.\n\nFinally, crowding distance, the spatial distance over which crowding occurs, in normal foveal (central) vision is small (2-4 arcmin) and cannot be measured with current standard clinical optotypes due to their large size (5 arcmin for 0.0 logMAR acuity). To get around this difficulty, a new vision test was recently created to quantify the crowding distance or \"critical spacing\" of crowding . It uses a new \"Pelli\" font, which is much thinner horizontally than standard clinical fonts, allowing the optotypes to get closer to each other in physical space. This 'Crowding Distance Test' permits quantification of the critical spacing of crowding for the first time in a clinical population. The new \"Pelli\" font, each optotype appearing like tall skinny numbers, has already been trialled on 'visually normal' school-aged children, but not yet examined on children with greater sensitivity to visual crowding, i.e., amblyopes. The third vision test in the proposed research, will investigate whether or not \"crowding distance\" measures made in each eye, results in greater inter-ocular differences, leading to better detection of anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia than does the current clinical standard visual acuity test, the Sonksen logMAR test (SLT).\n\nBy using closer first-order target optotypes, second-order target optotypes, and quantifying crowding distance in paediatric populations, the ability to detect amblyopia and monitor amblyopia treatment, could be significantly improved for the first time since the 1960s. At that time crowding was first quantified in a clinical population of adult amblyopes and was subsequently incorporated into commercially available tests as best practice."

                    "detailedDescription": "The GrowthMonitor app will calculate height data using smartphone images of children taken by parents or carers in the home at two or more set time points. The app will convert height data from the image to a numerical height measurement in centimeters and this will be transferred to a central database hosted on a secure UK based server with additional relevant demographic data (gender, ethnicity, weight, date of birth, and parents' height).\n\nThe height and demographic data are transferred with an anonymous identifier to a GDPR-approved secure database on a UK based server. Critically, patient images and children's names will not be transferred, and only authorized users will have access to the data stored within the secure database.\n\nThe app will display a virtual growth chart providing the patient with a digital history of the child's growth over time. BMI will also be calculated and plotted on an age- and gender-appropriate chart. Ultimately, users of the app will need to create an account using a username (email address) and password. We will use their email address so that password resets can be sent along with reminders or alerts about their account.\n\nChild's height in relation to his/her parental heights as well as longitudinal growth data will be analyzed within the secure UK based web server using existing growth monitoring algorithms.\n\n1. Height compared to population-based height references (HSDS)\n2. Distance from target height (calculated from parental heights, THSDSDEV)\n3. HSDS change over time (\u0394HSDS) -when more than one height measurement is available (taken \\>6 months apart)\n\nRecorded heights will be compared with pre-established cut-off standards that define normal growth in an appropriate population. We envisage being able to incorporate ethnicity-matched reference population data as the app evolves. An automated outcome will be returned to the parent/carer, via in app notification or email, and will offer advice, for example, confirming normal growth or recommending appropriate medical contact.\n\nData will be stored in such a way that users can sync their old growth measurements on to any new / replacement smartphone handset and also 'sync' any measurements taken offline.\n\nAn accurate standing height measurement will be obtained using a calibrated stadiometer during a patient clinic visit. This 'gold standard' height measurement will be performed by a trained member of the research team and documented. This will be used to compare with the height obtained by the growth monitoring app in the clinic and subsequently at home."

The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Tinostamustine in subjects with advanced solid tumours. Subjects will be given Tinostamustine via intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 15 of a 4-week cycle, the dose and infusion time will vary depending on the phase of the study.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The study consists of 2 phases and 2 sub-studies:\n\nThis study is a multi-centre, open-label phase 1/2 study of single agent EDO-S101 in subjects with advanced solid tumours.\n\nPhase 1 part of the study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the Pharmacokinetic (PK) of EDO-S101 as a single agent in patients with solid tumours who have progressed after at least one (1) line of therapy and for whom no other standard therapy with proven clinical benefit is available.\n\nPhase 2 part of the study is designed to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of the RP2D, plus the rate of patients with stable disease (SD) at 4 or 6 months, depending on the type of solid tumour. The RP2D was determined after phase 1 to be 80 mg/m2 of EDO-S101 administered over 1 hour on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 4-week treatment cycle.\n\nIn addition, two sub-studies are designed to better characterize the effect of EDO-S101: one at a dose of 60 mg/m2 administered over 60 minutes and the second at a dose of 80 mg/m2 administered over 80 minutes on cardiac repolarization (QTc) and other ECG parameters in the subjects with solid tumours.\n\nSubjects were eligible for these studies if they had a histologically confirmed solid tumour, signed informed consent and met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After providing informed consent, subjects were screened, and all procedures were performed as per protocol."

The RewP is a sensitive and specific biomarker of reward receipt. This proposal will advance a causal test of the hypothesis that there are two major sources of variance that contribute to this brain response: a dorsal midline contribution to information encoding and a ventral midline contribution that is modulated by affect. Together, these findings will reveal how the RewP acts to blend multiple aspects of value together in the service of motivated learning. The objective of this proposal is to gather pilot data to demonstrate the feasibility of using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to perturb idiosyncratically-defined (fMRI-based) dorsal or ventral targets in order to causally test the hypothesis that these different sources contribute different types of variance to the RewP. TMS double cone deep coil stimulation should diminish +RPE encoding in the RewP when compared to sham. TMS Figure-8 coil stimulation should diminish affective modulation of RewP amplitude when compared to sham."

                    "briefSummary": "Following the sudden and unexpected emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2009 H1N1) virus, this observational study was initiated to estimate rates of morbidity and mortality and to examine predictors of severity among participants with 2009 H1N1 infection. In 2011, as surveillance indicated that 2009 H1N1 virus was co-circulating with other seasonal influenza A and B viruses worldwide, the protocol was expanded to include other influenza A subtypes and influenza B viruses. The current version of the protocol (released in August 2013) further broadens the scope of this observational study. With the recognition that novel respiratory viruses other than novel influenza A viruses, e.g., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), could become prevalent and of major public health importance, the objectives of this protocol have been expanded.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this observational study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes over a 60-day follow-up period of participants with influenza virus infection (including influenza A subtypes such as H3N2 and 2009 H1N1, or influenza B), or a targeted non-influenza respiratory virus, who are hospitalized with severe illness and/or complications in geographically diverse locations.\n\nSpecific objectives related to influenza virus infection are to estimate the percentage of participants who go on to develop severe disease or complications that require hospitalization; to obtain information on risk factors for disease severity; and to establish a central repository of specimens for use in virus characterization, including subtyping, antigenic and genetic analyses, identification of signature mutations associated with antiviral drug resistance, mutational evolution, and additional reassortment.\n\nSpecific objectives related to novel non-influenza respiratory viruses of potential major public health importance are to characterize initial cases and their outcomes in order to develop more specific protocols that could inform the prevention and treatment of these new infections.\n\nThe information used from this study on participants with influenza and novel respiratory virus infections will be rapidly analyzed and shared broadly in order to guide policymakers and to design future studies.\n\nApproximately 500 patients with influenza will be enrolled each year at an estimated 75 sites which are in geographically diverse locations across several continents.\n\nStudy Plan:\n\n* Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at participating clinical sites.\n* Patients with a diagnosis of influenza (confirmed or suspected), who are hospitalized with complications or severe disease, will be enrolled.\n* At enrollment, consent is signed and information (demographics, medical history (including prior influenza and pneumococcal vaccination), medications (including antivirals) and treatments prescribed) will be recorded. A blood sample for serum and plasma will be obtained at enrollment, as well as an upper respiratory tract sample and lower respiratory tract sample, if appropriate. The respiratory specimens will be sent for central reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for influenza.\n* For participants who are still hospitalized, and not intubated, 5 to 7 days after enrollment an additional upper respiratory sample is obtained.\n* Status will be re-assessed at approximately 28 days and 60 days after enrollment and another blood sample for serum and plasma will obtained at both time points.\n* For participants who are mechanically ventilated additional upper and lower respiratory tract specimens will be obtained at specific timepoints.\n\nIn February 2012, the FLU 004 Genomics protocol v 1.0 was released to the field. In August 2013, v 2.0 of the protocol was released as INSIGHT Genomics. The protocol was expanded beyond the FLU 002 and FLU 003 studies to include all qualifying INSIGHT studies (list of qualifying studies is posted on the INSIGHT website, www.insight-trials.org). The purpose of this substudy is to obtain a whole blood sample from which DNA will be extracted to study polymorphisms in immune response genes and other genetic variants that may be associated with an increased risk of severe influenza.\n\nParticipating FLU 003 Plus sites are given the option to also participate in INSIGHT Genomics which requires a separate protocol registration. Participants, once consented to FLU 003 Plus, will be offered the option to also consent to INSIGHT Genomics which includes a single whole blood sample collection. Participation in FLU 003 Plus will not be compromised if a participant opts not to participate in INSIGHT Genomics."
