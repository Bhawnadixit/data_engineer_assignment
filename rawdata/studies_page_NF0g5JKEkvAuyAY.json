                    "briefSummary": "DMEK (Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty) is a surgical technique used to treat primary or secondary corneal endothelial decompensation. At the Rothschild Foundation, as in many Western referral centers, DMEK is currently the surgical technique of choice for the treatment of primary or secondary corneal endothelial decompensation.\n\nTechnically challenging, it is a relatively tedious surgery to learn, but offers the best visual and refractive results, as well as faster visual and functional recovery in simple cases.\n\nIn patients without anterior or posterior segment surgical history, the complication rate of DMEK, including graft rejection, is similar to that of other endothelial keratoplasty surgical techniques.\n\nHowever, in specific cases, in patients with a history of ophthalmological surgery such as vitrectomy, trabeculectomy, large iris defects, anterior synechiae, aniridia or aphakia, the scientific literature shows a higher complication rate for DMEK (increased rate of rebulling and graft decompensation).\n\nAs a result, other techniques that are less effective on visual results continue to be used for these patients in a large number of centers.\n\nNonetheless, in our department, DMEK is also performed on these complicated patients.\n\nWhen it comes to patients with a history of anterior or posterior segment surgery, it seems to us that the surgeons' experience with DMEK allows better visual results than with any other technique, but without any back up regarding the complication rate in the literature.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to describe, in patients with a history of anterior or posterior segment surgery undergoing DMEK, the 12-months occurrence rate of at least one serious post-operative complication."

                    "briefSummary": "Veterans with PTSD often have impaired social relationships and poor social support. The negative outcomes associated with poor social support are of particular concern for Veterans with PTSD, who often perceive the world to be dangerous, view their social support network as a threat to their safety, and avoid members of their support network in order to increase their perceived safety. The goal of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to Improve Social Support for Veterans with PTSD (ACT-SS), a treatment focused on helping Veterans with PTSD to increase social support with family relationships, partners, and peers by targeting maladaptive patterns of interpersonal difficulties, feelings of detachment from others, irritability, and avoidance of social situations. The primary aim of this study is to conduct a two-site randomized controlled trial of ACT-SS (n=75) vs. PCT (n=75), a common treatment for social support difficulties. If positive, this study will provide a critically-needed treatment for Veterans with PTSD to improve their social functioning and social reintegration in the community.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Veterans with PTSD often have substantial interpersonal problems and low perceived social support from family, partners, and peers. Interpersonal problems result in poor social reintegration, which in turn permeates all aspects of their functioning and is associated with greater suicidal ideation. The problems emerge rapidly, with one study showing a fourfold increase in rates of self-reported interpersonal conflict within six months of returning from deployment. Veterans with PTSD report considerable avoidance in relationships, marital stress, intimacy difficulties, and parenting problems. Low social support is a key factor related to poor physical health, emotional functioning, and increased mortality risk. Given the importance of social relationships in buffering against negative outcomes and suicidal ideation for persons with PTSD, there is a strong need for more research and treatment development to improve the social functioning of these Veterans. The proposed project will focus on evaluating an innovative treatment for improving the social relationships and social support among Veterans with PTSD.\n\nThe goal of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to Improve Social Support for Veterans with PTSD (ACT-SS), a treatment focused on helping Veterans with PTSD to increase social support with family relationships, partners, and peers by targeting maladaptive patterns of interpersonal difficulties, feelings of detachment from others, irritability, and avoidance of social situations. ACT-SS provides Veterans with PTSD with more adaptive coping skills (i.e., acceptance and mindfulness, focus on values-based living) to improve social relationships, social support, and help manage PTSD-related distress. The investigators' pilot data of ACT-SS indicates that ACT-SS results in improved social relationships and reduced PTSD symptoms, with preliminary data showing that ACT-SS results in significantly better improvement in social functioning outcomes compared to Present-Centered Therapy (PCT).\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to conduct a two-site randomized controlled trial of ACT-SS (n=75) vs. PCT (n=75), a common treatment for social support difficulties. Study outcomes will include measures of social support, social relationships, quality of life, and PTSD symptoms. This proposal, supported by the promising pilot data, represents an important step in examining the potential efficacy of ACT-SS, including social functioning and quality of life in Veterans with PTSD. If positive, results from this study may provide a new treatment approach for improving the social reintegration of Veterans with PTSD."

Participants will have Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that has advanced to Stage IV. Participants should not have been treated with drugs for Stage IV NSCLC, previously. All participants will get erlotinib alone, for approximately 8 weeks. Participants with radiographic disease control at the end of the erlotinib lead-in study period will be randomly assigned to receive LY2875358 plus erlotinib or erlotinib alone. Participants, who were chosen to receive erlotinib, alone, may cross over to the combination treatment at the time of progression."

                    "briefSummary": "This study is comprised of three separate pharmacogenetic trials grouped into a single protocol due to similarities in the intervention, the hypotheses, and the trial design. The three trials are the Acute Pain Trial, the Chronic Pain Trial, and the Depression Trial. Participants can enroll in only one of the three trials. All three trials were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT04445792. In July 2023 each of the three treatment trials was registered under a separate NCT# and NCT04445792 was converted to a screening record per recent guidance on master protocol research programs (MPRPs). This record is specific to the Acute Pain Trial within the ADOPT-PGx protocol.\n\nThe Acute Pain Trial is a prospective, multicenter, two arm randomized pragmatic trial. Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to either immediate pharmacogenetic testing and genotype-guided post-surgical opioid therapy (Intervention arm) or standard care and pharmacogenetic testing after 6 months (Control arm). The investigators will test the hypothesis that pharmacogenetic testing and genotype guided pain management therapy improves pain control after surgery in participants who's body processes some pain medicines slower than normal.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Pain and depression are conditions that impact substantial proportions of the US population. Finding safe and effective drug therapies for both conditions is challenging. In the case of treatment for acute and chronic pain, the challenge is finding effective therapy while minimizing adverse effects or opioid addiction (and the ensuing consequences). For depression, there are few clinically relevant predictors of successful treatment leading to multiple trials of inadequate therapy for some patients. Both opioid and antidepressant prescriptions can be guided by pharmacogenetics (PGx) data based on existing guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC).\n\nThis study is designed to evaluate the impact of pharmacogenetic testing and genotype-guided pain or anti-depressant therapy on pain control or depression symptoms in a pragmatic setting.\n\nThe rationale for examining a genotype-guided approach to acute and chronic pain management is based on the importance of CYP2D6 for the bioactivation of tramadol, codeine, and hydrocodone and data from a pilot study supporting improved pain control in intermediate and poor CYP2D6 metabolizers in the genotype-guided arm who are taking these drugs at baseline. Similarly, the rationale for examining a genotype-guided approach to depression medication therapy is based on the demonstrated role of CYP2D6 in the bio inactivation and CYP2C19 oxidation of select, commonly used SSRIs. Secondly, data from industry sponsored trials support the hypothesis of improved depression symptom control in a genotype-guided arm.\n\nStudy objectives:\n\nDetermine if a genotype-guided approach to acute post-surgical pain therapy leads to improved pain control compared to usual care, as defined by a decrease in the SIA score. Secondarily, The investigators will evaluate whether this approach leads to reduced use of DEA Schedule II opioids and reduced pain intensity."

Part 1 was comprised of participants with mild (Child Pugh A; Group 1) and moderate (Child-Pugh B; Group 2) HI and matched healthy control participants with normal hepatic function (Group 4). Groups 1 and 2 were enrolled in parallel. Part 2 was comprised of participants with severe HI (Child-Pugh C; Group 3) and matched healthy control participants with normal hepatic function (Group 4). Matched healthy control participants (Group 4) were enrolled in parallel to Parts 1 and 2.\n\nUp to 48 male and female participants, aged 18 to 70 years inclusive, were planned to be enrolled, with 8 participants enrolled in each of the mild (Child-Pugh A; Group 1 in Part 1), moderate (Child Pugh B; Group 2 in Part 1), and severe (Child-Pugh C; Group 3 in Part 2) HI groups, and up to 24 participants planned to be enrolled in the matched healthy control group (Group 4 from Parts 1 and 2). Additional participant(s) may have been enrolled if a participant discontinued from the study before completion of the PK assessment to ensure that at least 6 participants in each group completed the scheduled PK assessments. Due to difficulties in enrolling severe HI participants, only 7 severe HI participants were enrolled in this study.\n\nEach study part was comprised of a screening period of up to 28 days (Day -29 to Day -2), a Baseline evaluation on Day -1, and a treatment period including up to 8 days of safety and PK data collection. Participants who met the eligibility criteria at Screening were admitted for Baseline evaluations on Day 1. Baseline safety assessments were performed prior to first dosing of study treatment. Participants were domiciled from Day -1 through Day 8.\n\nAll participants received 25 mg remibrutinib b.i.d. orally under fasting conditions on Days 1 and 2, and a morning oral dose of 25 mg remibrutinib on Day 3. PK samples were collected predose on Day 3 and until 72 hours post Day 3 dosing. Throughout the study, safety assessments included physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation), and AE/serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring.\n\nThe investigator and Novartis conducted a joint interim review of safety and PK data from Part 1 before proceeding to Part 2. Data from at least 4 participants with mild HI (Group 1), 4 participants with moderate HI (Group 2), and their matched healthy control participants (Group 4), who completed PK study assessments up to Day 6 in Part 1, were evaluated.\n\nPart 2 only began after administration of remibrutinib in the 4 evaluable participants from each of the mild and moderate HI groups (Groups 1 and 2) and their matched healthy control participants (Group 4) in Part 1 was deemed safe and tolerable based on the interim review by the investigator and Novartis. Depending on the outcome of the interim review, administration of a lower dose of remibrutinib in severe HI participants (Group 3) and their matched healthy control participants was to be considered. However, upon review of the interim data, the decision was made to not change the dose for severe HI participants.\n\nAs per the current study protocol, study drug strengths available for this trial were 25 mg and 10 mg. Therefore, the lowest dose that could have been used in Part 2 was 10 mg b.i.d. At the time of the interim data review, a decision was to be made as to whether or not to reduce the Part 2 dose, based on observed PK exposures and safety assessments in Part 1 and predicted exposures in severe HI participants in Part 2. In this particular case, Part 2 was to be initiated after the submission and approval of a Substantial Amendment from the respective Health Authorities (HA) and Ethics Committee (EC) were obtained. A decision was made to proceed with Part 2 using the same 25 mg dose as in Part 1.\n\nStudy Completion evaluations occurred on Day 8, followed by a post-study safety follow-up contact (e.g., follow-up telephone call, e-mail) approximately 30 days after last administration of study treatment. The information collected during the follow-up contact was kept as source documentation. The study was considered completed once all the participants finished the required assessments.\n\nThe total study duration for each participant was expected to be up to approximately 62 days, including the Screening period and the follow-up contact."

History of GI bleeding within the past 3 months prior to Screening.\n43. Documented presence of esophageal varices (Stage 3 or 4) based on the evaluation of the participant's medical history at Screening and Baseline.\n44. History, clinical evidence or suspicion of a hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) based on sonographical and/or laboratory results (i.e., \u03b1-fetoprotein \\[AFP\\] \\> 12 IU/mL \\[2 \u00d7 ULN\\] at Screening).\n45. Severe ascites and/or pleural effusion.\n46. Participants with clinical evidence of suspected acute liver failure as judged by the investigator.\n47. Clinically significant illness within 2 weeks prior to first dosing that could have jeopardized safety of the study participant and/or altered the study results as judged by the investigator.\n\n    Healthy control participants (Group 4)\n48. Significant illness which had not resolved within 2 weeks prior to first dosing of study treatment.\n49. Liver disease or liver injury as indicated by abnormal liver function tests at Screening. Any single parameter of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) exceeding 1.2 \u00d7 ULN or \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 ULN TBL OR any elevation above ULN of more than one parameter of ALT, AST, GGT, ALP or TBL.\n50. Known to have Gilbert's syndrome.\n51. Positive result for HBsAg or HCV antibody at Screening.\n52. Hemoglobin levels below 11.0 g/dL for males and 10.0 g/dL for females at Screening or Baseline.\n53. History or presence of impaired renal function as indicated by clinically significantly abnormal creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and/or urea values, or abnormal urinary constituents at Screening.\n\nIn the case where a safety laboratory assessment at Screening or Baseline was outside of the range specified above, the assessment may have been repeated once at Screening and/or once at Baseline. If the repeat value remained outside of the specified ranges, the participant was excluded from the study.",

                    "briefSummary": "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) poses challenges in achieving optimal three-dimensional correction. While posterior fusion with pedicle screws has shown success, osteotomy techniques, such as Ponte osteotomy, have further improved outcomes. However, residual vertebral rotation remains a concern, impacting long-term complications. Intervertebral disc release (IDR) presents a potential solution to enhance derotation and reduce fusion levels, particularly in Lenke Type 5 AIS. This prospective randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of IDR in treating Lenke 5 AIS, comparing it to Ponte osteotomy. The study focuses on axial vertebral rotation correction, coronal curve improvement, blood loss, hospital stay, and adverse events. Participants aged 10-18 with Lenke 5 AIS will undergo either IDR or Ponte osteotomy, randomly assigned. Outcome measures include axial rotation correction rate, radiographic parameters, and clinical assessments. A total of 132 participants will be recruited. The IDR technique, through posterior disc removal, presents a promising approach to optimize derotation in Lenke 5 AIS. While offering potential advantages, challenges like limited working space and bleeding risks require careful consideration. The study's findings aim to provide robust clinical evidence, enhancing treatment strategies for Lenke 5 AIS and offering innovative approaches for AIS as a whole.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Hypotheses To examine the clinical effectiveness of intervertebral disc release in treating Lenke 5 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, our working hypothesis posits that participants treated with intervertebral disc release achieve a higher rate of correction for axial vertebral rotation (especially the rotation of the apex vertebrae), demonstrate improved correction rate for coronal curve, experience no additional blood loss or allogeneic transfusions, and do not experience an increase in the length of hospital stay (LOH) or adverse event (AE) rate compared to individuals treated with Ponte osteotomy.\n\nObjectives Based on the aforementioned hypothesis, this study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of intervertebral disc release in treating Lenke 5 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The evaluation includes assessing the efficacy of vertebral derotation and the change in Cobb angle following the correction surgery, as well as perioperative blood loss, transfusion volume/rate, length of hospital stay, and the rate of adverse events (AEs).\n\nStudy setting and investigators The trial will take place at a tertiary care teaching hospital. The study will be conducted in the wards and operating rooms of the orthopedic department, which has 200 beds, at this comprehensive hospital with a total of 2500 beds. Participants will be recruited from the outpatient clinic by one investigator and will provide their consent to the investigators. All investigators have practical experience in clinical orthopedic research projects. A single team of surgeons, who have completed a clinical fellowship in spinal surgery, will perform the surgeries.\n\nParticipants The study will enroll patients between the ages of 10 and 18, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of I-II. These patients will be diagnosed with Lenke 5 type adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and will require posterior correction, internal fixation, and bone graft fusion. Enrollment in the study will be contingent upon signing a written informed consent.\n\nPatients with a history of previous corrective surgery, or with sharp, angulated short-segmental scoliosis, and those with congenital scoliosis requiring 3-column osteotomy will be excluded. Participants who experience dura mater laceration or unexpected massive bleeding during the operation will be excluded as well.\n\nRandomization and concealment Before commencing the study, an independent researcher with no participant contact will utilize SAS 9.4 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to generate a blocked random number table (block size = 4). This table will be used to allocate eligible participants in a 1:1 ratio to 2 groups. A group designated as the IDR group will undergo subsequent intervertebral disc release following Ponte osteotomy on the predetermined vertebral levels, whereas the PO group will solely undergo Ponte osteotomy.\n\nData collection and monitoring The collected data will be entered into electronic case report forms (eCRFs) through a process of double data entry and logic validation. Subsequently, the eCRFs will be uploaded to a central server. To uphold the trial's quality standards, a proficient clinical trial expert will be invited to perform audits of both the trial implementation process and data entry on a bimonthly basis. The purpose of the regular audit is to ensure adherence to the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs). The expert may review source documents to verify the accuracy of the data recorded on CRFs. During each audit, all study records from the past 2 months will be thoroughly examined to ensure the quality of the trial conduct and the consistency between the source data and the data entered in the database. This study will not include any interim analysis.\n\nSample size and statistical analysis This trial will recruit 132 participants (66 participants per group) to confirm the primary outcome equivalence between IDR group and PO group. According to a prior study, the correction rate of axial rotation of the apex vertebrae is 0.60\u00b10.23. Assuming that alpha = 0.05, power = 0.95, two-sided 95% CI, and the follow-up loss = 15%, 66 participants are needed for each group. G-power software version 3.1.9 was used for calculating the sample size. The primary outcome measures the correction rate of axial vertebral derotation. The mean values and standard deviations of these outcomes will be calculated for both the intervention and control groups. To assess the differences between the two groups, independent sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests will be performed. Secondary outcomes measure\u00e5 such as blood loss, allogeneic transfusions, length of hospital stay (LOH), and adverse events (AEs) will also be analyzed. Continuous variables (e.g., blood loss, LOH) will be analyzed using independent sample ttests or Mann-Whitney U tests, while categorical variables (e.g., allogeneic transfusions, AEs) will be analyzed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate. The difference between the IDR group and PO group will be reported as mean difference and lower one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), along with a one-sided p \\< 0.05. Statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS.\n\nDissemination plan The trial results will be submitted to an international peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, the findings will be presented at relevant national and international conferences."

                    "detailedDescription": "A variety of surgical methods have been reported to reestablish root coverage, including tunneling techniques and coronally and laterally advanced flaps. As thin gingival tissue is one of the predisposing factors for GRD, the adjuvant use of subepithelial connective tissue grafts (CTGs) is often considered. CTGs are thought to contribute to phenotype modification and stability of treatment outcomes and studies have indicated favorable esthetic results and high degrees of root coverage. CTGs are preferably harvested either from the lateral superficial part of the palate or from the tuberosity, due to the high amount of lamina propria and minimal submucosal tissue (adipose and glandular tissue).\n\nWhen multiple adjacent teeth exhibit GRDs, the preferred surgical approach should offer the greatest possible root coverage, while limiting drawbacks (i.e., patient morbidity, esthetic problems). Thus, one of the challenges related to coverage of multiple GRDs is the scarcity of donor tissue. Modification of the harvested CTG into multiple \"micro-CTG\" has been proposed for the treatment of multiple adjacent GRDs (MAGRD) in order to reduce the amount of CTG to be harvested. Soft-tissue grafts from the tuberosity are increasingly gaining popularity not only because they are easier to harvest, are denser in connective tissue fibers but also because harvesting from the tuberosity presents minimal risk of intra- or post-operative complications, resulting in reduced patient morbidity. However CTG from maxillary tuberosity have been reported to induce a hyperplastic response in some patients.\n\nThe objective of this study will be to compare palatal versus tuberosity micro-CTG on postoperative pain, oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), degree of root coverage and esthetic outcomes.\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that no statistically significant differences will be observed in terms of %root coverage and patient satisfaction at 12 months (non-inferiority). Subjects in the test group (micro-CTG) will report significantly lower morbidity at 1 and 2 weeks post-surgery when compared to controls (superiority)."

This study consists of a screening period (to occur at least 3 days after MI diagnosis), a 6-month double-blind period, and a 6-month extension period with the End of Study (EOS) Visit at Day 360/Month 12.\n\nTwo dosages of CDR132L will be tested against placebo on their effects on patients, who just had a heart attack in addition to standard care. The aim of the study is to show that CDR132L is safe and effective to improve heart failure in such patients."
