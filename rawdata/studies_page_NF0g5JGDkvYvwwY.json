                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this Prospective interventional multicenter diagnostic study is to investigate the use of diaphragmatic ultrasound (DE) as a diagnostic tool in an adult emergency department for patients in acute respiratory distress.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is to evaluate the relevance of measuring the Sum of Plateau Times (SPT) by Clinical Ultrasound in Emergency Medicine (CHEM) for the diagnosis of pneumopathy during acute respiratory distress (ARD) in the Emergency Department.\n\nSecondary objectives include the study of other diaphragmatic ultrasound parameters, inspiratory plateau time (IPT) and expiratory plateau time (EPT), and the diagnostic relevance of PTS for the diagnosis of decompensation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (BPCO) and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (APO).\n\nEach eligible patient will have a right diaphragmatic ultrasound performed by a trained physician, then clinicobiological data will be collected later from medical records, and the etiological diagnosis will be established by a committee of 2 experts in the management of respiratory distress.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Diaphragmatic ultrasound (DE) has never been studied as a diagnostic tool in the emergency department. The sensitivity and specificity of pleural ultrasound for the diagnosis of pneumopathy is superior to that of chest radiography, with evidence of interstitial syndrome or unilateral pleural effusion, but it is not specific for infectious pneumopathy. Proving that diaphragmatic ultrasonography can be used to diagnose pneumopathy in respiratory distress, thanks to a specific index known as the Sum of Plateau Times (STP), will save time in patient management.\n\nThe secondary criteria of this study could be used in future studies, if they prove relevant."

The probe is positioned in the sub-costal region between the mid-clavicular and anterior axillary line on the right, and between the anterior and middle axillary line in the sub- or intercostal region on the left. The liver is used as an acoustic window for the right hemi-diaphragm. The probe is oriented medially, cranially and dorsally.\n\nThe operator switches to time-motion (TM) mode when an angle of over 70\u00b0 is achieved between the upper part of the diaphragm and the analysis axis in the most cephalic part of the diaphragm.

Interested participants will be seen at 8 (-3 to +4) days after discharge from the hospital. At this visit, participants will be randomized 1:1, in varying blocks, stratified by site, to video telehealth PR plus standard of care versus standard of care alone. The telehealth intervention will involve 3 exercise sessions a week for 12 weeks. Exercise sessions will be provided in real-time via live two-way videoconferencing using a HIPAA-compliant app on an encrypted smart phone or similar device. Each session will be standardized to include cardiovascular (aerobic) training, strength (resistance) training, breathing exercises, and education that includes smoking cessation counselling where applicable, inhaler use techniques, diet, and nutrition. Participants in both the intervention and control arms will receive standard of care per local guidance. During the period of active intervention, participants in both arms will be contacted monthly to ascertain any exacerbations. Questionnaires and assessments of function will be administered at the baseline 8 day visit and at completion of the intervention at 13 weeks. Subsequently, participants in both arms will be called 3-monthly to ascertain healthcare utilization, and questionnaires and assessments of function will be repeated at the end of the follow-up period at 52 weeks."

                    "briefSummary": "Fluids are one of the most common treatments given to patients in the hospital. Fluids are especially important in treating patients with sepsis. Multiple clinical studies have compared the two main types of fluids used in sepsis (normal saline and balanced crystalloids). However, these studies have not found a clear benefit of one type of fluid versus the other. Which fluid should be given to which patient is an essential question because of the ubiquity of this intervention. Even a small difference in mortality could drastically change the standards of care given the national (and worldwide) scale of this intervention. The investigators have developed an algorithm that uses bedside vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) to identify a group of patients (Group D) who have a significant mortality benefit from balanced crystalloids. The study randomizes adult patients admitted through emergency departments across 6 Emory hospitals belonging to Group D to intervention versus usual care. The intervention arm involves a prompt to clinicians to use balanced crystalloids rather than normal saline.",
                    "detailedDescription": "In this study, the vitals trajectory algorithm will run on all adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) across the Emory Healthcare hospitals. Patients will be enrolled and eligible for randomization once they meet suspicion of infection criteria. Suspicion of infection is defined broadly as the ordering of blood cultures in the emergency department. Group D patients with a blood culture order in whom clinicians initiate a normal saline order will be randomized within the electronic health record to either usual care or the intervention arm. In the intervention arm, if a clinician orders normal saline in a patient classified as Group D, there will be an EHR alert to change the order to balanced crystalloids (i.e., Lactated Ringer or Plasma-Lyte solution). The alert will announce that preliminary data suggests a mortality benefit from balanced crystalloids in this patient and will ask the clinician whether there is a strong clinical indication to use normal saline.\n\nThe intervention is intended to start as early in the hospitalization as possible in the emergency department, as early crystalloid resuscitation choices may have effects on outcomes. The primary analysis is an intention-to-treat analysis (i.e., all patients randomized to intervention versus usual care regardless of whether the intervention resulted in a change in fluid choice). The intervention will be continued only for patients admitted from the emergency department to the intensive care unit. For patients in the intervention arm who are admitted to the ICU, the alert will fire every time normal saline is ordered till ICU discharge, death, or for up to 30 days of hospitalization. The intervention is necessarily unblinded when a clinician receives an alert when ordering normal saline on study patients."

Body composition will be assessed using ultrasound measurements and the validated method of air displacement plethysmography (ADP).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Determine the effect of a handheld Force-Measuring Ultrasound Probe on intra- and inter-observer variability in ultrasound measurements. A device which measures the force applied to the ultrasound probe will be used to obtain measurements of muscle and adipose tissue thickness (biceps, abdomen, and quadriceps) in toddlers."

                    "briefSummary": "The study hypothesis is that the antidepressant effect of psilocybin is mediated by a normalization of the functioning of the positive valence system. Depressive states, especially moderate to severe depressions that associate a certain level of anhedonia, produce an overvaluation of the cost of efforts and an infra-evaluation of the possible rewards derived from an action. Psilocybin would reduce anhedonia and the cost of efforts, facilitating the anticipation of reward. Thus, the antidepressant effect of psilocybin would be mediated by a greater anticipation of rewards (reduction of anhedonia) and a more optimistic estimation of the results of efforts (increase in motivation). Psilocybin-induced changes in the positive valence system will be observable on brain MRI images, particularly in the effort evaluation circuits: basolateral amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, ventral pallidum, ventral striatum (VS), ventral tegmental area (VTA). The mesolimbic circuit (VS, VTA) is the anatomical substrate of anticipation of rewarding stimuli (food, sex, drugs). The amygdala also fulfills an associative function between environmental cues and rewarding stimuli. Structural and functional alterations in this circuit are associated with depressive symptoms such as anhedonia or distortions in the perception and memories of rewards. This hypothesis will be tested on a population of patients with moderate or severe depressive symptoms who meet the criteria for TRD.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Depressive disorders are strongly associated with suicide risk and are the leading cause of disability in the world. Psilocybin is a natural alkaloid with psychedelic and hallucinogenic effects, produced by its active metabolite: psilocin. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of research aimed at using psilocybin in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, and in particular depression, combined or not with various psychotherapeutic programs. Psilocybin-assisted therapy is effective in treating cancer-associated depression and resistant depression. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has designated it as a \"Breakthrough Therapy\" in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Most researchers consider that the antidepressant effects of psilocybin are associated with the activation of the serotonin 5-HT2a receptor, with acute neuromodulation effects that modify the connectivity of cortico-striatal loops, but the mechanisms supporting this effect are unknown. The purpose of this study is to verify whether the antidepressant action of psilocybin is associated with an activation of the brain areas involved in the positive valence system, by comparing the activity of the neural circuits responsible for the evaluation of effort before and after taking psilocybin. The correlations between the activation of brain areas and the depression severity, behavioral activation and anhedonia scores will help establish a link with the response to treatment. Finally, the study authors wish to test the feasibility of a study with psilocybin in a French clinical population."

The sample of the study will consist of premature infants who are receiving treatment and care in Izmir Provincial Health Directorate Izmir City Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit within the central borders of Izmir province and who comply with the research limitations to be examined for ROP.\n\nStage 1: The research will start after the ethics committee and institutional permissions are obtained. The group in which the babies will be included will be determined by randomisation method. In the clinic where the research is carried out, ROP examination is performed on a certain day of the week, so the families of premature babies who meet the inclusion criteria will be informed about the research and their verbal and written permissions will be obtained.\n\nStage 2: On the day of the examination, fresh breast milk will be obtained from the mothers of the babies in the breast milk group. Mothers of premature infants in the mother voice group will be asked to make a voice recording before the examination.

                    "detailedDescription": "The use of effective and efficient non-pharmacological methods to reduce the pain and stress experienced by premature babies due to retinopathy examination and to increase their comfort has an important place in supporting optimal growth and development. This study was planned to reveal the effectiveness of different non-pharmacological methods during the examination performed within the scope of the screening programme for prematurity.\n\nThis study will be conducted to examine the effect of breast milk smell and mother's voice on pain and comfort in retinopathy examination in premature infants. The sample of the study will consist of premature infants who are receiving treatment and care in Izmir Provincial Health Directorate Izmir City Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit within the central borders of Izmir province and who comply with the research limitations to be examined for ROP.\n\nData Collection Breast milk odour group: On the day of the study, the mothers of the babies will be contacted and fresh breast milk will be obtained from the mother of each baby. In the study, a sterile sponge will be used to smell the breast milk to the baby. Breast milk will be taken as 2 ml, dripped onto a sterile sponge and held 10 cm away from the baby's nose and sniffed 2 minutes before the examination.\n\nMother voice group: Mothers of premature babies in the mother voice group will be given a voice recorder on the day of the study and will be encouraged to express their feelings and thoughts and say what they want to say to their babies and will be asked to talk to their babies as they wish. The mother's voice, which is recorded 2 minutes before the procedure, will be placed approximately 30 cm away from the baby's ear and a loudspeaker will be placed at the foot end so that the baby can listen to the sound. The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends a sound level of 45-50 dB for premature babies. Therefore, the sound level will be measured with a decibel meter and set to 50 dB.\n\nControl group: In the guideline prepared jointly by the Turkish Neonatology Association and the Turkish Society of Ophthalmology in 2021, it is recommended that the baby should be held by a nurse in such a way that the baby's head and arms are fixed, and the baby's hands and feet should be gently flexed or loosely swaddled during the retinopathy examination. Within the routine practice of the clinic, the babies in the control group are held.\n\nStage 1: The research will start after the ethics committee and institutional permissions are obtained. The group in which the babies will be included will be determined by randomisation method. In the clinic where the research is carried out, ROP examination is performed on a certain day of the week, so the families of premature babies who meet the inclusion criteria will be informed about the research and their verbal and written permissions will be obtained.\n\nStage 2: On the day of the examination, fresh breast milk will be obtained from the mothers of the babies in the breast milk group. Mothers of premature infants in the mother voice group will be asked to make a voice recording before the examination. 'Introductory Information Form' will be filled out before the procedure.\n\nStage 3: Video recording will be made to evaluate the pain, stress, comfort and physiological parameters of premature babies. Video recording will be started 2 minutes before the examination. Video recording will continue for 5 minutes after the ROP examination.\n\nStage 4: Breast milk odour, mother's voice and physiological parameters of the babies in the control group will be recorded 2 minutes before the examination, 2 minutes after the end of the examination and 5 minutes after the end of the examination.\n\nStage 5: The babies in the breast milk odour group will be made to smell the styrene sponge dripped with their own mother's milk 2 minutes before the procedure.\n\nStage 6: Babies in the mother's voice group will be made to listen to their own mother's voice 2 minutes before the procedure.\n\n7th Stage: Babies in the control group will be subjected to the routine practice of the clinic.\n\nStage 8: The videos recorded after the interventions and the scores given to the PIPP, CEQ, and PBQ scales will be evaluated by two independent faculty members who are experts in their fields."

Statements including 7 items such as gestational age, behavioural status, highest heart rate value, lowest oxygen saturation value, forehead wrinkling, squinting and widening of the wings of the nose are questioned. Each item is scored as 0, 1, 2, 3 from good to bad. The baby's pain is calculated over the total score. The highest score is 21 and the lowest score is 0.
